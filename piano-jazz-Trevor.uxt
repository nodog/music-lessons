note taking => opt-j = ∆, opt-o = ø, ♮

Started taking jazz lessons from Trevor

2017-10-27

  He likes my random key/practice program. Wants me to add melodic minor, too.
  Likes the initial weightlifting and scales practice.
  Add in arpeggios of all inversions of all 7 basic jazz piano chords for the key.
     6   -6   -7   -7b5  7   o7  Maj7

  Suggests working on 2 songs at a time.
  For now, looking at Autumn Leaves and adding Take the A Train.
    Autumn Leaves : common key = Gm (not as written in Em)
    Take the A Train : common key = C (as written)

  each song
    Practice in the most common key and the random key of the day.
    Either before or at middle of song practice do arpeggios of every song chord.
    Practice the rhythm as written, then add after mastered.

  standard ways to play jazz chords with a band
    - shell chords - 1 and 5 in LH and 3 and 7 in RH
    - rootless - 3 + 7 + color notes in LH and melody in RH
      - good when playing with bass accompanist
    - practice drop 2/3/4 voicings also

2017-11-03

  From questions:
  - For the fingering of arpeggios, look at one position for each block chord.
  - Add in a metronome ASAP, but be reasonable on learning new material.
  - Drop chords are intended to be both hands. Use close voicing for 1 hand play.
  - Note played under D-7 or F6 will determine which it is.
  - Ascending melodic minor in classical is just kind of melodic minor in jazz.

  General
  - Pratice swing pieces w/o swing up to around 90-100 bpm, then add swing.
  - When working on longer groups of fast notes, group notes together, then shift
    the start of the groups when trying to connect them.
  - Transposing
    - chords
      - think of the starting chord, and then the relationship to the next chord.
    - Use whatever technique gets you there for each song.
      - Shortcuts are not cheating; they are how you make it happen.
  - Look for measures where "inconsistent" chords come into a song. This may be the
    use of "modal mixture," where different scales of the same key are used for
    specific effect. This informs soloing during that chord.
    - Measure 6 of Autumn Leaves is an example of this. The modal mixture is used for
      a strong cadence, and this is a typical usage of modal mixture.

  Autumn Leaves
  - Get the chords solid before trying to add the b9 to the B.

2017-11-10

  From questions:
  - Try metronome on the 2 and 4.
  - Try to start on a chord inversion, great.
  - Singing while soloing is great. Try to limit the instrument range to your vocal
    range for now.
  - Practice sight reading with EYES ON THE MUSIC.
  - Practice Hanon with EYES ON THE MUSIC.
  - Some inversions do feel/sound better. Feel free to switch it up.
  - Shell chords have 2 definitions
    - 1 - playing with group - 3+7 chord
    - 2 - playing solo - LH root + 3 or 7 and RH melody
    - Exercise for #2 - see exercise #2 on staff paper
  - Try to clap the 6 lines of the rhythms Trevor gave - exercise #1 on staff paper.

  Take the A Train
  - Switch to doing close voicing + melody only.
  - Switch to C major only.
  - Practice every change in a 3-4-1(change)-2 repeat manner. Play 3 times perfectly,
    then check to see if that made a difference in context.

  Autumn Leaves
  - Switch to doing close voicing + melody only.
  - Switch to Gm only.
  - Write out on staff paper for Gm.

2017-11-17

  From questions:
  - Walking bass ideas I was using on Deep River Blues for Edim7
    - Yep.
    - Another style is to use 1 and 5 only (with octaves).
    - Also, use approach notes (short chromatic notes leading up to actual chord tone.)
  - Electric pianos are cool and offer great dynamic practice.

  rhythm exercise
  - Don't just try and try. Think through the rhythm before trying if necessary.
  - Even write out the rhythm above the notes.
  - Count all beats out loud for now. (1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&)

  ii-V-I exercise
  - Mostly a LH technique, but maybe play 1 chord tone in RH to accompany.

  Take the A Train
  - Yes, keep the original sheet b/c D9(#11) is complicated.
  - Go ahead and move into the B section.
  - Start practicing with both the 1st and 3rd inversions.

  Autumn Leaves
  - Yes, resetting to original position after 8 bar descent is great.
    - Also, can follow raises in the melody for repositioning.
      - Note how the ii-V's are tied together by melody notes in this song.
  - Start practicing with both the 1st and 2nd inversions.
  - Voice leading -> 7th goes to 3rd, 3rd goes to 7th.
  - Add back the chord style of 3rd+7th in RH and root in LH.
  - Move into the C section. (It's form is A B C D (?).)

  Start listening to Blue Monk!

2017-12-01

  From questions:
    - The LH root + RH 3+7 was intended to help with voice leading.
      - Don't worry about flavor notes (ex: b5) as these don't lead.
      - For a triad, think of the root in place of the 7.
    - The minimum jazz starter kit was pretty awesome, though Trevor would
      deprioritize the quartal chords and the stride bass.
    - In general, for standards you can probably leave out 9s, as they were probably
      added after the piece was written (except where the 9 is in the melody).
    - For a minor key, the standard ii-V-I becomes iib5-V7-im7.
    - Only for rootless chords does the C9 become a C7 with the root replaced with a D.
    - One way to make memorizing a chord chart (a goal) easier is to think in terms of bigger chunks.
      Ex: "Oh, the 2nd 4 measures are just ii-V-I."
    - Jack White's chords in Love Interrupted are not strictly in key (E G A E, E G D A).
      - This is an example of modal mixing.
    - Q - Is jazz too big? (Am I setting myself up to fail by opening this closet to Narnia?)
      - A - Regardless of how deep I go into Narnia, I'll bring something interesting back.

  Autumn Leaves:
    - The progress that I have made with this seems too slow compared to Take the A Train,
      so let's put this on hold.
    - In the B section the Ebmaj7 is in parens b/c it's not typically there at all.

  Take the A Train:
    - Today was the first time I tried improvising.
    IMPROVISING:
      - Important: In jazz, because the chords switch keys/modes you'll need to switch
        which scale you're improvising/soloing in to match.
      - For section A, the D7b5 chord is out of the Cmajor key which the other chords are in.
        - Use a D based whole-tone scale (or optionally a diminished scale).
          - A WHOLE TONE SCALE is a scale composed of only whole steps between the notes.
            (There are only 3.)
          - A diminished scale (also called the cotatonic) is a repeat of
            alternating half-steps and whole-steps. (There are only 2.)
      - When improvising, limit yourself (rhythmically, region of the kybd, etc) in order to
        focus creativity.
      - Some notes should be treated as "avoid notes." Generally the 4th of a major chord.
      EXERCISE - Record yourself playing bass and chords and improvise over that.

  Blue Monk:
    - PRINT IT!!

2017-12-15

  General comments:
    - Using a comping rhythm is great.
      - The Charleston rhythm is a standard: From 1&2&3&4& 1-.&....
    - Scale practice:
      - Try coupling -- adding harmonic notes below the note being played in the melody.
        - Ex. Add in-scale 3rd below the note of the scale being practiced.
      - Add coupling a 3rd in both hands (or at least 1 hand).
      - Add broken chords with the 3rd.

  Improvising:
    - Create an overall structure for the improvisation.
      - Ex. Generally up for first repetition of A, then generally down for second.
    - Don't always need to end on the root note.
      - Ex. A 5th will lead the listener into the beginning of the next repetition or solo.

  Take the A Train:
    - Work on that C6 G-7 C7 F◬7 change at the end of 2nd rep of section A into the bridge.
    - Keep practicing with comping rhythms.

  Blue Monk:
    - Practice with RH coupling of 3rds.
    - Practice with LH playing bass notes only.

  Questions:
    - Q: Should I be able to just play a set of new given chords?
      - The point of all the arppeggios is so you'll know the chords immediately.
    - Q: What to do when both hands are told or need to play the same note?
      - Replay it and let the melody note end without replaying the chord note.
    - Q: In blues, does one solo in the root key or in the key of the chord?
      - Both and mix.
        - Can play in the root key with some notes left out for different chords.
        - Can play in new key for every chord.
      - Also can use mixolydian scale with added b3 and b5 in blues instead of
        standard blues scale.
    - Q: Colorado Cookbook?
      - It seems to be really accurate and good.
    - Q: Why is the a C# and a Db being noted close together.
      - Because otherwise there'd be even more fixes of accidental notation.
    - Q: Is a master class in front of other people?
      - Yep. And probably not even Trevor teaching, but don't worry, other people
        interested in jazz would be there and excited to play, too.
    - Q: Is it normal that performance is at about 80% of practice ability.
      - Yep. It's a long time before the energy of the audience contributes to a
        better performance.
    - Q: Suggestions for a free music day?
      - Scales and arpeggios. Play each piece of music in every style.

2017-12-22

  Questions:
    - Q: WHY does the chromatic melody of Blue Monk work, when similar runs
        nearby don't?
      - Because the runs are between chord tones! Emphasis is given to the
        beginning and end of the runs.
    - Q: What are my goals for the master class in the Spring?
      - Trevor would like me to be able to do close voicing in the LH while
        being able to either play melody or improv in the RH.

  General Notes:
    - When playing with the random notes, try to be open to possibilities.
    - When repeat-practicing difficult changes, ignore ties across breaks.
      It's easy enough to add them back in later.
    - Ease off on the Charleston rhythm if that's causing frustration with melody.

  Improvising:
    - Don't just step up and down scales. Skip around more.
    - Think about structural aspects:
      - Simple to complex. (How many notes in a time frame?)
      - Short to long notes.
      - Amount of space between notes.
      - Use repeats of notes to keep the melody simple, but the rhythm complex.

  Take the A Train:
    - Keep working at the fast changes. Think about the fingering before playing.

  Blue Monk:
    - Use simplified chords for practicing improv and coupled 3rds for now.
    - Watch the fingering on the long melody run.
    - Repeat measure 4 and integrate it.

2018-01-01

  General notes:
    - Take coupled 3rds out of scale practice.

  Take the A Train:
    - Practice rootless voices every time now, for the performance.
      - Play with recorded bass notes, so it doesn't sound weird.
      - Play exactly as written.
      - Generally, sub the 9th for the root, and the 13th for the 5th.

  Questions:
    Q - Should I bother playing close voice chords in both hands simultaneously?
      A - Nah. Just play more realistic musical situations.

  Improvising:
    - Play more than one note at a time.
    - Try one low chord tone while doing other stuff above it.

  Homework:
    - Look at the Jazz Piano Book - look at 3 note voicings p18-20.
    - Bring back 3 licks from recordngs of Blue Monk.
      - At least one must be a lick from a different instrument.

2018-01-05

   General notes:
   - Ways to make regular chord progressions jazzier, look at Chap4 of Berklee
     Jazz Piano, Tension Substitutions.
   - Work on pushing your solos a bit. Try what "feels" right. Do remember that it
     can be a balance between being boring and alienating a listener.

   Blue Monk:
   - Pick a lick and learn it in at least Bb, Eb, and F.

   Questions:
   - Leave rootless voicings as is for now. Just play chords and don't worry
     about held melody note issues.

2018-01-19

  Take the A Train:
  - Avoid using straightforward scale steps in improv, especially over D7b5, because
    the whole tone scale doesn't really have any resolution points.
  - Try scalar steps over ii-V-I, try to hit chord tones at appropriate moments, avoid otherwise.

  Blue Monk:
  - Feel free to write out the Griffin lick in other keys if necessary.
  - When playing 7th of chords, the mixolydian mode for improv sounds great.

2018-01-26

  Improv:
    - Freddie Freeloader is ripe for lick mining.
    - Try to have a really strong beginning and ending for a solo section.
      It's what people remember.
    - Start out with some simple repetition. Build up in complexity.
      Save the best for last.
    - Remember to musically cue that you're coming to the end of a solo.

  General:
    - Be sure to be on or after the beat. No rushing.

  Blue Monk:
    - leave out F7 half measure for now.

  Upcoming:
    - Listen to "So What" on _Kind of Blue_ (modal tune).
      Check out Real Book lead sheet -- D dorian, Eb dorian, D dorian.

2018-02-02

  Comping:
    - Try to be on 8th note rhythms.
    - Generally keep the individual notes short.
    - Vary the length of the notes.
    - Always listen to others and try to fit in to what others are doing.
    - Try to change up for the B section.
    - Keep using rootless voicings, but switch to two-handed voicings.
    - Can also use a rootless LH + 1's and 5's in RH high for a thick sound.

  General:
    - Practice is always a balance of bringing technique up to intuition.
    - Leave out notes in LH chord that will be played as part of the RH melody.
    - Try to be on or follow the beat.
      - Listen to Count Basie to get a feel for this.
      - Play on the beat!

  Improv:
    - Improv around simple ideas, but build progression and complexity.
      - 1/2 to 3/4 way through A section is a good place to start increasing.

  Blue Monk:
    - Go ahead and play a chord on the 1 of the last measure.
    - Play with a root voicing near middle C.
    - Try playing with a backing track to get a better feeling for the rhythm.

2018-02-09

  General:
    - rhythm/timing exercises to improve your groove
      - Do scales or a tune with click on 2 and 4 of beat.
      - Slow Jam
        - Slow down the metronome to 20 bpm or so.
        - Try to play notes just on the click.
        - Subdivide in your head to make it possible.
      - 4 on 4 off
        - Set metronome to play on measure all 4 beats, then one measure no beats.
        - Improv over it and make sure you're coming back in on the clicks.
      - 1 and done
        - Set metronome to 1/4 actual tempo, and try to keep it on the 1.
      - 1-1 and done
        - Set metronome to click on 1 of meas 1 and 2, then silence for meas 3 & 4.
        - Play a tune over this.
      - Syncopation nation
        - Only click on 2's a & 4's and in measure 1, silence is meas 2.
        - Play only on the clicks
      - The disorienter
        - Only a click on the 2 - play a tune over it.
      - Song form exercise.
        - Set click for downbeats of meas 1 2 3 4 5 & 9 of 12 bar blues.
    - For recordings with more than one keyboard instrument, look to
      In a Silent Way.

  Improv:
    - a couple of types of non-accented tones:
      - passing tone - pass across this note between other accented notes
      - neighbor tone - reach up or down to this note and then back
    - avoid tones - note in a scale that should not be accented
      - the 4th in a major or dominant chord is an avoid tone (not with minor chord)
    - blues - use double notes dropping from blue note to scale tone
      to emulate guitar bends
    - Find a lick from Freddie Freeloader.
      - Look at the "nuggets" between the melody parts for some blues idioms.

  Blue Monk:
    - Change up the voicings in the LH. - Try for 3+7 + 9 or 13.

  Take the A Train:
    - Comping:
      - Be sure that you are synchopating enough.
        - Try to shift the chord change forward by an eighth.
        - In the turn around, try
          |: 1 & a 2 & a 3 & a 4 & a | 1 & a 2 & a 3 & a 4 & a :|
             *         *           *             *

  Love Interruption
    - Try blues soloing over root chords.
    - Try mixolydian soloing (b7) over root chords.

2018-02-16

  Blue Monk:
    - For this week, probably, just keep working on 3+7 in the LH for bass.
    - Later can add 9 for 1, or 13 for 5, or both. (Also in jazz arps at some point.)
    - Blue Monk should be a 1 thing per week song.
    - Practice hands separate for now, until perfect at 70 bpm, then put hands together.
    - Look at the fingering on the sheet to get chords into muscle memory.
    - On 3rd measure 2nd note, make sure the coupled 3rd is Eb.

  Improv:
    - Should be about 80% steps and 20% skips.
    - Try using only chord tones for a bit.
      - Make sure to focus on a different chord tone for different instances of chords.

  Take the A Train:
    - Practice anticipations even on the 2nd rep of the A section.

  General:
    - Try turning off drum track on iRealPro!

2018-02-23

  General:
    - Can use alternating intervals to practice scales.
    - Be aware of the clave rhythm. It may come in useful for two handed rhythms.
    - Start looking at ear training. App - MelodyET

  Blue Monk:
    - Pay attention to the fingerings during the melody of Edim7.
    - Start paying attention to the articulation of "swing."
      - It's the important "next step"
    - Try playing allong with Art Blakey's version.
    - Remember to play E°7 in the LH during 3+7+tension for chords.
    - Try to bring tempo up to 90 bpm in 2bpm bumps for LH chords.

  Take the A Train:
    The written lick:
      - When playing w/o swing really hit the sub beats.
      - Uneven swing notes should also be uneven in volume. Work on offbeat swing as stressed.
      - pay attention to fingering and be consistent.

  Improv:
    - When playing simple parts, be sure to think about articulation.
    - Remember to make it sound like singing to engage the listener.
    - Try scatting some, and singing your solos!
    - Try starting a new improv phrase *not* on the 1.

2018-03-02

  Blue Monk:
    - go to 2 hands 2 meas at a time, get perfect @ slow.
    Improv - once hands together practice with metronome on 2&4

  Improv:
    - Form short ideas (2 to 4 beats for now), and repeat these
    - /Can/ find common tones across multiple chords to avoid chord change problems.
    - In contrast, can repeat the same motif in the same location, changing the notes
      to match the current chord/scale. Ex: Use the same melodic idea w/a Db instead of
      a D when playing over Eb after being on a Bb.
    - Keep thinking about articulation.

  Take the A Train:
    - Use measure 6 to practice the articulation of off beats as well.

  Ear Training:
    - Find examples of all the intervals.

  Questions:
    Q. Do multiple performers usually only communicate through the solos?
      - Yep. That's what jazz is all about.
    Q. What is happening at 2:53 of Bill Evans' "Two Lonely People"?
      - Standard preceding note, just executed incredibly well.
    Q. Should I be trying to use example intervals for ear training?
      - Yes!
    Q. Does your metronome app have a slider for "amount of swing"?
      - No, and I wouldn't use it if it did. *That* you need to feel.

2018-03-16

  General:
    - Get back to doing the rhythm exercises!
    - Get back to doing sight reading exercises!
    - Avoid rushing by remembering -- you have more time than you think.

  Improv:
    Approach Notes:
      - A note before the note you intend to play above or below the note.
        - Below is a half-step below. Above is a scale tone above (diatonic).
      - You can play "just chord tones (1-3-5-7) apreggiated" improv by using approach notes.
        - Tensions (9-11-13) are often approach notes, so the chord tones remain rooted.
    - Focus on "lower neighbor" approach notes this week.

  Comping:
    - Play more staccato.
    - When playing 2 short stabs, make the first long and the second short.

  Take the A Train:
    - Try playing just the melody and really lag the beat.

  Questions:
    - Whole tone scale is played over 7b5.
    - Chords are played in solos when appropriate, but not necessary.
    - Altered chords refer to chords with flatted and sharped tensions.
    - Jazz player who just "got" their talent often memorized albums, note by note.

2018-03-23

  General:
    - For ii-V-I, improv the maj I scale, using chord tones appropriately.
    - Keep on working on the rhythm exercises.
      - Really listen to recordings, tapping along.
      - The drummer will be on the beat.
      - As a soloist, you're the one who gets to play ahead of, on, or after the beat.
    - Try the new blues lick using coupled 3rds.

  Improv:
    - Watch out for holding solo notes too long.

  Blue Monk:
    - Can add Eb below high F for transition to F chord.

  Accompanying:
    - Stay out of the singer's range.

  Bass Lines:
    - For now, just try half notes 1's and 5's.
    - Move to a new root position for each chord (UNLIKE what you do with voice leading in the RH).

  Questions:
    Q - Should I add tensions to the dim7 chords?
      A - Not for now.
    Q - Do 6 chords already have a 13?
      A - Effectively, yes, so 9 can be subbed for root, but that's about it.

2018-04-02

  Take the A Train:
    - Watch rushing the LH and in measure 2.

  General:
    - Keep trying the be ahead/be behind exercise.
    - Tips to get comping out of a rut.
      - Try inverting voicing.
      - Use approach notes for whole chords.
      - Be aware of how you're comping and try to do something different.
        - Record yourself and transcribe the rhythm.
      - The "long-short" comping idiom is more relevant at slower tempos.

  Improv:
    - Trevor played chords and let me scat over it.
      - He throught it sounded good, and we should focus on getting that through
        my fingers and into the piano.
    - Record yourself scatting and transcribe it for a solo.
    - Prioritize ear training now to get to better soloing from scatting.

  Blue Monk:
    - Move to accenting one of the sets of 8th notes (on or off beat).
      - On beat is easier.

  Questions:
    Q - How old is Trevor?
      A - 22
    Q - When playing 8th note swing, where do 16th notes go?
      A - When playing 16th notes, it goes back to straight time.

2018-04-06 (out-of-sync lesson)

  General:
    - Behind the beat is also know as "dragging" and "laid-back."
    - Drums can be a good clue about what to listen for. Generally:
      - Bass is ahead of the beat.
      - Snare is behind the beat.
      - Hihat and Ride are right on the beat.

  Accompanying:
    - Structure:
      - 1 chorus vocals, 1 chorus solo instr, 1 chorus vocals.
      - Mix up with 1 chorus vocals, 1/2 chorus solo instr, back half chorus vocals.
        - Instr noodling in the bridge.
    - For non-solo time, LH bass + RH chords.
      - Chords can be minimal (3+7), basic (1+3+5+7), rootless, or whatever.
      - Rhythms should be as necessary to comp, but definitely off-beat 8th notes.
    - Fills:
      - Look for ways to fill the melody out during pauses in the vocal melody.
      - Avoid the vocalist's range. Try to fill above it if necessary.
    - Soloing:
      - Bass Line:
        - Simple: Play just the root.
        - Walking Bass:
          - Play quarter notes from the scale. Play 1 or 5 on beats 1 and 3.
            All other quarter notes should be a chord tone or a scale note.
          - Also can use the standard approach notes on off beats, too.
        - Stride:
          - Play root and fifth notes alternating on each 1 and 3 beat.
            - Easy: Play in the same position as the rest of the chord.
            - Hard: Play octaves 1-2 octaves down from the rest of the chord.
          - Play the rest of the chord on 2 and 4.
            - Closed position (notes in order) or open position (3rd up an octave).
        - Ballads:
          - Tend to be much more free form:
            - 10ths in the LH
            - Arpeggiated chords
            - Rootless in the RH
      - Chords:
        - Shell chords are good for accompanying.
        - Try to reach a 10th to keep them really open.

  Solo piano:
    - You'll need to fill out the solos more with the chord tones (more intervals
      and block chords).
    - Block chords becomes a more reasonable solution (with melody line as top note).

2018-04-13

  General:
    - Start singing the jazz arps. Both alone and with the piano.
    - Laid back exercises:
      - use a metronome and clap behind the beat
      - play 8th notes 1 measure on, then 1 measure behind the beat
  Comping:
    - 10% held notes is fine.

  Blue Monk:
    - Practice "cheat" legato. Keep the top note legato, even if the bottom isn't.
    - You are rushing the solo and/or going off pulse. Play the solo w/o LH to practice.
    - Practice solo w/ irealpro and metronome to stay laid back/late.

  Take the A Train:
    - Make the bridge (B) different.
      - Comping: Use inversions.
      - Soloing: Use block chords, intervals, chromatic movement, fills.
    - Don't rush!

  Questions:
    - Sub 13 on -7 is actual a maj 6, because it's from melodic minor scale.
    - E whole tone scale has a 1-2-1 fingering on the white keys.
    - Memorizing stuff:
      - Write down chords away from the piano.
      - Chunking.
      - Learn stuff by ear.

2018-04-20

  Ear training:
    - For intervals:
      - Focus first on "is it wider or narrower than a fifth?"
      - Then try to rate it on dissonance or consonance.
      - Then guess.
      - For larger intervals, may be helpful to think of the octave, then the 2nd note.
    - Another skill is, once tonicized, what scale degree is being played?

  General:
    - Rhythm:
      - Jazz idiom is to make notes written long shorter, and notes written short longer.
        - Maybe not ballads this way.
      - Phrase originally vocal melodies as voice would.
      - While working on laid back, try counting subdivisions out loud.
      - Try to be on beat this week. Count and subdivide to help.
    - More dynamics!
      - Try crescendo and dimenuendo within phrases. (Swells)
      - Sing a phrase and try to match dynamics.
    - Soloing:
      - Play on the downbeat more w/ the solo. At least every other measure for now.
      - Also try starting on the "and" of 1 or 2, instead of the 2.
      - Try to extend ideas.

  Take the A Train
    - Phrasing
      - Try to use longer dynamics and articulation.
      - The biggest issue is rushing in phrasing.
      - Don't rush the C in the 2nd measure of A.
    - Articulation refers to how a single note is played.
    - Phrasing is the way a musician shapes a sequence of notes in a passage of
      music to express an emotion or impression.

  Blue Monk
    - Work at playing the parallel thirds at the same time.


2018-04-27

  Composition:
    - Some rules to go by (and break if appropriate):
      - Don't repeat things more than 3 times.
      - The third repetition should be different.
    - Suggestions for Sky Prowler:
      A Section:
      - Shift notes and small groups of notes forward or back an 8th note
        to change the rhythm in repetitions.
      B Section:
      - On repeated chords move half step up or down on the last one.
      - Turn long repetions into not quiet exact repetitions.
        - Specifically move some of the always-off-beats to not-always.
        - Maybe make the 2nd or 3rd set of off-beat chords into on-beat,
          but leave the single notes on-beat. (Chords off of melody notes.)
      - Let the last note lead back into section A.
      Everywhere:
        - Add 9's and 13's.
        - Add neighbor tones and neighbor chords.

  Questions:
    - Something about Sloan's "only been playing jazz for 2 years"/
      "learned everything by ear"/"jazz band in high school"/"italian
      restaurant gig" statements don't add up.
    Q - Should I try to play the recital?
      A - Sure, but "Blue Monk" is probably the right piece for that.

  Blue Monk:
    - To play as a solo, try playing full 4 note chords during the head,
      and rootless during solo.

  General:
    - Trevor gone May 17-Jun 12
    - Add rev direction arps back into jazz arps.
    - New songs
      - Summertime ??
      - Miles Davis - Tune Up (listened, don't love it)
      - All of Me

  Soloing:
    - This week should work on getting more synchopation naturally.
      Get off the beat!
    - Work to get more constant 8th note lines
      - Aim for chord tones on the first and third beat.
      - Take time to find the correct distance between.
      - Play scales
      - Play jazz arps
      - try continuing past a chord change

2018-05-04

  Ear training:
    - First step is internalizing the tune.
    - Next transcription:
      - There Will Never Be Another You
        - showtune or simple (unison horns?)
        - on youtube?
    - Transcribing:
      - Clef and key on every line.

  Soloing:
    - Try to keep momentum in a direction going with every 8th note played.
    - Bring back lick harvesting from heads.
      - Look for showtune versions for straightforward approaches.
    - Using triplets sometimes is a fine choice.
    - Need to keep gathering licks from other songs. (Heads for now, see Transcribing.)
    - Need to keep gathering licks from vocal improv.

  Summertime:
    - This is going to be the new song. :)

  Questions:
    Q - You had me put 9ths and 13ths into my jazz arps (and Sky Prowler). Should I also be adding 11ths?
      A - No. That's the next level, not an in between level.
    Q - Will the recital be metronomeless?
      A - Yes.

2018-05-11

  General:
    - A half-diminished 7th (ø7) is the same thing as a -7b5.
    - Good to know > minor 251 is iiø7 - V7b9 - i7.
    - Try to play the melody in the highest RH fingers and fill in chord tones below the melody.
      - Avoid minor seconds when the melody note is a non-chord tone.

  Summertime:
    - Try using the general technique of chord-tones below the melody above.
    - technique:
      - Measures 1-4 try descending top chord note (7th or 6th).
      - Measures 5-8 all chord tones below the melody.
      - Measures 9-12 try descending top chord note (7th or 6th).
      - Measures 13-16 all chord tones below the melody.

  Soloing:
    - Only go to hightest notes a few times.
    - Practice arping through chords (rooted, rootless, both!)

  Questions:
    Q - Given where I am and rate, how far do you think I am for getting on stage for 1 song?
      A - A year.

2018-05-18

  Temporary teacher: Emil Pohlig, espohlig@gmail.com 801.404.4557

  Summertime:
    - Practice the block of mid-meas-2 to mid-meas-4. (C-A-E xition)
    - Don't play C on beat 1 of meas 6.
    - Move hand position in between E's of meas 12.
      - And add D in the chord. o.O
    - Any chord written w/o a 7 is still a 7.

  General:
    - Pro tip - sometimes it's okay to hold down two keys with the thumb!

2018-05-02

  All of Me:
    - How do I want to play this?
    - How to play it for different settings? Solo piano - head, improv; in combo - head, improv

  There Will Never Be Another You:
    - Keep transcribing.

  Summertime:
    - Keep working as you have been.

2018-06-15

  General:
    - Yay! Trevor's back!
    - In LH, instead of octave, try playing 1+10.
    - Remember that the minor 2-5-1 is iiø7 - V7 - i-7.
      - Good to play harmonic minor of the 1 over this.

  Summertime:
    - Move to playing shell chords in the LH -- 1+3 or 1+7
    - If 7ths sounds muddy in LH switch to 10ths (probably around A2 is lowest good root for 1+7).
    - Start playing the D-7 G7 in meas 12.
      - This starts a ii-7 - V7 - i∆7
    - For C in meas 13, leave out C and E in RH, then play the E on the 2nd beat.
    - For A in meas 13-16, play LH A+G (1+7) and leave out G in RH.

    - improv:
      - On long minor sections, can play blues/minor pentatonic, or A dorian.
      - 6 in the natural minor is the 4 of the relative major, and the "avoid tone."
      - by measure:
        1 -  4 -  A dorian
        5 -  6 -  D dorian
        7 -  8 -  A harmonic w/chord tones
        9 - 11 -  A dorian
       12 - 14 -  C major w/chord tones
       15 - 16 -  A dorian on out

2018-06-22

  General:
    - Keep working on ear training.
    - Keep working on transcribing Frank Sinatra's version of There Will Never Be Another You
    - Try to play through old songs 2X weekly.

  Summertime:
    - Keep the bass note the lowest, even if your LH needs to move around.
    - In meas 5-6, walk down the lowest RH note through E to Eb w/xition to F7 chord.
    - In meas 7, be sure to play the b5 (F).
    - Remember to keep the melody note the top of the RH.

    - Improv exercises:
      - When repeating short groups of chords for improv practice:
        - Try to change up the rhythm.
        - Try to push through some invented patterns.
        - With ii-V7-I, try chord arps in the RH.

2018-06-30

  Lessons: Currently owed 90 min.

  General:
    - Scale Practice:
      - don't do modes in scale practice for now
      - change to 2 octaves for arp practice
      - change back to 7.5 min for arps
      - practice everything legato
      - add a ii-V-I pratice in key - LH voicing inverson - RH super simple in key improv/lines

  There Will Never Be Another You:
    - Try Keely Smith version

  Ear Training:
    - Keep at it!
    - Categories:
      - Dissonant: m2 ∆2 tritone m7 ∆7
      - Consonant: m3 ∆3 p5 m6 ∆6
      - Grey: p4

  Transcribing:
    - Try to use straight-ahead vocal recordings, because they're generally easier.
    - Do smaller chunks rather than slow down the audio.

  Summertime:
    - Generally headed in the right direction. Keep going
    - Improvising:
      - Exercise: Do RH-quarter note arpeggios LH-chords. Connect LH arps thoughtfully.
        - Stick to one pattern and think about fingering b/w RH chord arps.
      - Can use aeolian OR dorian when the root key is a minor chord.

  Questions:
    Q Is McCoy Tyner playing 8th triplets in "Speak Low" on _Portrait_?
      A No, at that fast tempo, swung 8ths generally get moved more toward straight 8ths.
    Q Is playing triplets during a swung tune a thing?
      A Yes. Happens a lot in the blues.
    Q Should I avoid playing chords on the 1 while comping?
      A In swung tunes, stay off the 1 in general. Use sparingly. Ballads and Latin music are different.
    Q Should I use a drop voicing to make the melody stand out?
      A Not really how Trevor thinks of it, but sure, why not?
    Q Is lydian ii-V-I a thing?
      A Modal ii-V-I is not *popular*, but nothing wrong with it.

2018-07-06
  Summertime:
    - Focus slow repetition on measures 11-13.
    - In meas 5-8, add extra chromatic descent in 5-6, add11 to Bø7, add b9 to E7

  Improv:
    - Try counting while improving.
    - When you get stuck in a range, jump to get out, but flow out in the opposite direction of the jump.

  TWNBAY
    - See if you can finish it this week.

2018-07-13

  - This week, put Summertime above anything else. Make progress here.

  General:
    - Substitutions in jazz chords:
      - For ∆7, 7, and -7, use 9 and 13 sub.
      - For -7b5 (ø7) and o7, use 11 sub for 3.
      - For 6 and -6, use 9 sub.
      - Also see chart on p 14 of Berklee Jazz Piano book.
    - Jazzing up melodies/the head:
      - Add fills on the long notes.
      - Try to not musically repeat.
      - Delay or anticipate by eighth notes.
      - Try first by feel, then see what seems repetitive, go back, and try to fix.
      - Think about how it feels to sing it, and don't over do an particular non-vocal-like effect.
    - On the piano, it's about creating layers and the placement of the layers in foreground/background.

  Pedal:
    - Don't use it as a cheat.
    - Don't overdo it. Don't soup it up too much.
    - Try to use the pedal in the gappy spots.
    - Remember to pedal up *after* the beginning of the start of the next note.
    - Half-pedaling on keyboards allows variable muting. FA-08 *can* do this!

  Listening:
    - Wynton Kelly
    - Summertime:
      - Miles Davis off Porgy and Bess
      - Freddie Hubbard off Artistry of ...
      - John Coltrane off My Favorite Things

2018-07-20

  Summertime:
    - Sectional practice this week.
    - Review sections from the day before.

    Pedaling:
      - Try to pedal all the time w/release just after 1 & 3.

    LH:
      - Go into lower register or octave, depending on whether you want more open or stronger sound.
      - Especially on the 2nd and 4th line.

    Soloing:
      - Leave more space.
      - Play sporatic long notes to draw in the listener.
      - Roll chords/intervals to lengthen them.
      - Sing internally if you can.

2018-07-27

  General:
    - When playing melody as the top notes of the chords, practice playing that melody note louder than the rest.
      - Classical players refer to this as "voicing" the melody.
        - Note this is a new meaning to the word "voicing."
      - This is especially necessary when melody note is next to a chord note.
      - When practicing this, make sure to keep the wrist and arm relaxed.

  Summertime:
    - Try playing the hands individually. Do this at a higher tempo.
    - In lines 1 and 3 (meas 1-4 and 9-12):
      - Keep holding down the C in the LH as you can, but
        - vary between fifths and octaves of the A.
        - try to add some leading eighth notes before half notes.
    - When playing LH chords & RH guide tones, add in all chord tones to allow for better melodic direction.
    - On slow lines, add ornamentation
    - Always be thinking about musicality.
    - STOP RUSHING!! PAY ATTN TO BEING LAID BACK AGAIN.
    - Transcribe the rhythm of the MD Summertime lick.

  When playing with a drummer and/or a band:
    - Lock in with the drummer, especially the ride (this will be the pulse).
    - Stick to some easier keys if possible. C, F, G major; A, D, E minor; etc
    - Listen to the bassist.
    - Keep from staying in your head. Listen to and respond to what others are doing.

  So What
    - Bass line is part of the head! Learn it!

2018-08-03

  Scheduling:
    - Currently owed 90 min of lessons.
    - No lesson 8/10.
    - Yes lesson 8/17.
    - No lesson 8/23.
    - Yes lesson 8/31 at noon, and owed 210 min of lessons (3.5 lessons).

  General:
    - For now, when working on making one note stronger, try using just 2 fingers.

  Summertime:
    - Walking bass:
      - Bring more chord tones to the RH.
      - For now, focus on efficient fingering.
      - Approach half notes with differnt eighth notes.
        - In scale above, in scale below, chromatic, etc. (listen!)
    - During LH chords + RH improv,
      - Record! Develop and embellish
      - Focus on each hand separately while playing.
      - Do some things with both hands in same rhythm.

  Exercises:
    - AFK:
      - Try tapping rushing/on/lagging the beat with recorded music.

  So What:
    - Try fingering chords in RH as 1-3-5 then 1-2-4 and LH as 4-1 and 5-2.

  In exercise session:
    - Go for a clean, firm touch to really work on a clean sound. Will improve speed later.
    - II-V-I:
      - Add LH 3+7 RH 1+5 (or 9+13) to playing style.
      - Look to add minor ii-v-i for chords.
      - Look to add blues in major 3rd above key center in RH.
    - Add finding quartal chords in root key at different octaves. Later add planing.

  Playing with others:
    - Try playing head and improv melodies doubled in both hands.

2018-08-17

  Watched Aimee Nolte video about playing along with internal melody (made up or remembered)
    - Trevor loved it and thinks we should integrate some of that into practice.

  So What
    Add to practice
    - Walk the chord shapes up and down the scale.
    - Try to sing notes in the scale while playing any Dm.
      - Pay attention to 9, 11, and 13.
      - Play all if you can.

  Summertime
    - Keep chunking away at it.
    - Add to practice:
      - Write out the actual music of what you're playing and memorize that.
      - Practice being on guitetones (and maybe root) for simple improv.

  General
    - Add to practice:
      - Add in lead, follow, and and sit on beat.
      - Sing the arpeggios.
      - Try to sing an octave below high notes.
    - Look at BPM tracker app to use for rushing/dragging practice.

2018-09-02

  - currently at a 120 min deficit

  Summertime:
    - Get transcription of what I'm actually playing done this week.
    - Work on bass LH
      - half notes are not really a walking bass, but sounds good
      - try some eighth note neighbor tones or repeats or roots and fifths
    - Improv:
      - LH chords + RH:
        - keep tempo with metronome
        - keep tempo with irealpro
        - keep tempo with left foot - slow and work hard
    - Exercise:
      - LH chords + RH chord arps.

  Walking Bass:
    - general characteristics
      - quarter notes
      - chord tones on the 1 and 3
      - passing tones or arp tones on the 2 and 4

  General:
    - When looking at quartal voicing exercise, only look for minor key quartal voicing.
      - Don't worry about what scale you're in for now.
      - Planing exercise with _So_What_ is a different exercise.
      - Also, the song you found while planing quartal voicings was _All_Blues_
    - Exerice:
      - Dm - play chord, hear tone, sing tone, check yourself and what scale degree it is
        - try for chord tones for now

  So What:
    - Keep plugging away at it.
    - Improv:
      - Try planing with the melody on top.
      - Remember to mix it up.
      - Look out for clipping off phrase or accidentally accenting the 1 & 3.
        - Try a 2 & 4 metronome while improving.
      - Watch out for avoid notes (4th), even in quartal voicings.
      - Try improv with LH plays RH of the quartal voicing and RH improvs. Also for Eb.

2018-09-03

  Exercise:
    - Try to sing a chromatic scale while playing only the root. CHECK YOURSELF!

2018-09-07

  currently at 60 min deficit

  Summertime:
    - Practice playing Summertime from my written arrangement.

  So What:
    - Focus on LH top quartal voicing + RH improv with irealpro

  Freddie Freeloader
    - We made a lead sheet. Start playing through it.

2018-09-16

  General:
    Improv:
      - Try playing RH improv + outloud counting + irealpro

  So What:
    Improv LH:
      - 1 bar each of D then C.
      - Charleston rhythm of D followed by C.
    - Currently the Eb section is slower
    - Keep practicing slowly enough to not make mistakes anywhere
      - Pace the whole song slowly enough get the Eb section right
    - Keep improving over irealpro to feel the 8 bar phrases

  Blue Skies:
    - pick an arrangement to make a lead sheet from

  Summertime:
    - Try to look at the music while playing - learn it from the page.
    - Improv over bass line instead of over chords.
      - exercise 1 - aim for intervals of 3rds and 6ths from bass note
        - ex: F & B over bass D, F & C over bass A
      - exercise 2 - play block chords w/melody in top note (fingers 4 and 5)
        - "improv using chords instead of single melody notes"
        - can change the whole chord on every note
        - can change the chord notes (lower) with the melody note staying static
        - can keep the chord notes static with the melody notes changing

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Figure out the rhythm of the lick you found the notes for.

2018-09-21

  So What:
    - practice head w/ 2 & 4 metronome
    - make sure chords are punchy
    Improv:
      - try 3 styles: no LH; 1 bar D, 1 bar E; and free LH
      - when free LH:
        - you played mostly only short notes in both hands. mix it up.
        - try to do one hand long while the other does short, then reverse
        - shoot for variety
    - Come up with 3 very different licks and write them down for next lesson

  Improv:
    - Come up with a list of solo techniques to draw from
      - scalar patterns in sequence
      - interval patterns in sequence - extend to triads and seventh chords
      - quartal voicing pattern in sequence
      - same rhythm movement in both hands
      - move LH around but have RH focus on 1 note, use to build tension at chord change
      - make a 2 hand voicing and use planing
      - make a low 5th interval, then move elsewhere
      - "lickish" - 1-4-5-1 - like "Love Supreme"
      - bluesy licks

  Summertime:
    - Keep up bass line improv with focus on 3rds and 6ths IN SCALE

  Practice:
    - Switch to a play through Summertime - then extra technique on Summertime
    - Switch to a play through of So What - then extra technique on So What
    - make backing random: ireal pro, 2+4 metronome, or nothing

    - back catalog needs to be if I have extra time in the evenings

2018-09-28

  Summertime:
    - Bump the tempo down on the metronome. If below 50, try straight 8th note beats.
      - Try 44 and run the metronome at 88.
    - Improv - Do both hands jazz arps.
      - Start each chord low and go up
      - Go up then down
    - For Summertime practice session:
      - 3 choruses - head, jazz arps, head
      - after do RH improv alone @ higher tempo w/irealpro

  So What:
    - Licks created this week:
      - match A and match B
        - they're really 2 different licks. Use them separately or together or reordered.
      - wobble
        - feels a little stuck in the A to G bit. maybe move a different note in
        - triplets on top of swing is totally fine and common
      - memory falls
        - suggestion to extend a note.
    - FOCUS: Come up with 3 more licks.
      - Can use DAW or musescore to try to hear what you've written and whether it's accurate
    - Push the tempo on this up. Go for 80 for now.

  Improv:
    - More smooth 8th note lines.
    - How would Miles phrase this?
    - Comping should remain short.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - See if you can get one more phrase.

2018-10-05

  General:
    - Coming up with chord progressions in key quickly:
      - Look at the chord progression flowchart.
      - I - IV - V - I always good
      - VI is also very popular, and a II.
      - I - VI - V - I
      - I - III - II - V - VI

  So What:
    - structure solo lines in 2 & 4 bar phrases to help keep track
    - note that there is a whole measure @ end of head for solo intro
    - count it out loud

  This was spent transcribing Blue Skies by Willie Nelson.

2018-10-19

  currently at 60 min deficit

  General:
    - Change the ii-V7-I exercise into multiple progressions
      - minor of ii-V7-I
      - Add in I - IV 2nd inv - I - V 1st inv - I
        - major
        - minor (V will be V7 regardless of what the scale tells you)
          - This is like using the harmonic minor for the V

  Summertime:
    - Practice big hand transitions
    - Keep the melody in your head during slow tempo practice to keep timing right
    Q - During solos, do I play the F7 as the underlying chord?
    A - No, stay on the D-7.

  So What:
    - Solo - switch up what you're doing
      - try to get away from the call and response, by playing over the chords
        and comping over the solo time
      - during solos *don't* have to play the next section's chord during the
        last bar of the 8 bar phrase

  Blue Skies:
    - Write out the 8ths in the B section

2018-11-02   currently at 60 min deficit

  General:
    - Playing with others:
      - Get better at inversions by playing the same chord in multiple inversions.
        - Use different inversions to sound different while comping.
      - Play back and forth with including/excluding tensions (especially the highest note).
      - Do close voicing in LH, use RH to do fills.
    - For playing with 3+7+flavor in RH, choose 9s or 13s as appropriate for the voicing.
      - It will alternate for ii-V7-I∆7.
      - Try to keep to 9s in a minor chord, b/c 13 causes a -2nd.
      - Spread or choose inversion to avoid -2nd.
      - Move the bass note lower to avoid muddiness or dissonance.
    - Chord progression practice
      - Can go to 2nd inv on V7 for I-IV-I-V-I exercise.416

  All of Me:
    - Focus this week.
    - Keep the chord around middle C (probably 2nd inv) to keep it from getting muddy.
      - Learn two different inversions so you can switch for variety.
    - Improve comping rhythm.
    - If you have a bass player, don't play root notes in bass register at all.
      - Go for two handed voicings.
        - Can do double close voicing for now.
        - Try spread voicings later.
    - Soloing/scales
      - major scale goes over root major7 chord
      - mixolydian mode goes over dominant 7 chord
      - dorian mode goes over minor 7 chord
      - lydian mode goes over non-root major 7 chord (especially root)

         | A | C∆       | %         | Emix         | %         |

             | Ddor     | Gmix      | C∆ (chd tns) | (chd tns) |

  Blue Skies:
    - Really focus on LH chord + RH fills.
    - Possibly use octaves of descending notes in RH (meas 1-4).
    - Possibly double the melody for the last lyric (meas 6-7).
    - Can split triads 1-5 + 3-5.
      - Try to not double 3rds unless it's the melody note.

  Quartal voicings:
    - The exercise Trevor was getting me to do was using "So What" voicings.
    - So What voicings for minor chords will have the root at the base.
    - So What voicings for major chords will have the 3rd at the base.

  So What:
    - Shift practice to 1 run and then practicing soloing.
    - Solos:
      - Move back and forth b/w LH chords and no chords (focus on RH).
        - Alternate first by choruses.
        - Alternate later by 8 bar phrases.

2018-11-09

  General:
    - Ab blues breaks the "no thumb on the black keys" rule.
      LH 2 1 4 3 2 1
      RH 1 2 3 1 2 3

  All of Me:
    - Check new real book for chords (7ths). Oh, yes, the chords are different.
    - Maybe don't want to add 7ths over F & F- b/c the melody implies an F6 and F-6.
    - Focus on fingering this week.
    - Remember 8th note swing on non-quarter-note triplets.
      - Count swing 1-a-2-a...
    - Switch practice to 5 min melody, 5 min chords, 5 min hands-together.
    - Tagging is the repeating of sections at the end.
      - VERY helpful for a singer.
      - Play last 4 or 8 bars of the chords.
      - If playing improv, play the melody for at least the *last* 4 bars.
      - Playing a 5th in the bass over the whole intro is an option.
      - Simply a 1/2 chorus solo w/last 4 bars in melody.

  Blue Skies:
    - To play with the band.
      - LH chords + RH fills
      - RH doubles the descending note playing fast alternating octaves w/pedal.
      - In bridge, maybe play a 6th below the melody for harmony.

2018-11-16

  General:
    Questions:
    - On scales or arps, try singing the next note before playing, then checking.
    - During week 1, only play Blue Skies and All of Me. Week 2 add other songs back.
    Free Improv:
    - Can use "flashcards" to guide "movements."

  All of Me:
    - Practice transitions for chords.
    - Start using a metronome for melody.
    - Improvising:
      - Practice using chord tones as jazz arps.
        - Pay attention to the guide tones during fast chord changes.
      FOCUS week 1 - 7.5m hands together, 7.5m improv w/LH chords

  Blue Skies:
    - Think about how to comp this in a jazz way, instead of a pop way.
      - Try comping rhythms filling in during empty melody parts.
      - Anticipate chord changes by an 8th note.
    - Try to create counter melodies when supporting a soloist.
      - Aim for 3rds and 6ths on beats 1 and 3.
    - Update transcription to give the bass notes to the band.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - FOCUS week 1 - As soon as you can, play hands together.

2018-11-30

  General:
    - Blues jam happens on Mon nights at 10p at Dozen Street
    - When practicing to play with a band, priority to LH chords, RH melody.
    - School is on winter break from dec 22 to Jan 1. Trevor gone dec 21st, we restart Jan 4.
    Questions:
      Q - What to do if no bass player?
        A - Keep it simple!
            - Play a 1-5 bass line.
            - Move LH back and forth b/w chord and bass note.
      Q - Suggestions on what to do with electronic session?
        A - 4th voicings
          - Add bass notes
          - Don't try to force some structure onto electronic improv
            sessions that doesn't fit.
          - Try going slightly out of phase.
          - Try pulling freq spectrum out of a hat.
      Q - Have you used a practice journal?
        A - Nope.
          - Seems like a waste of time to keep if no purpose.
          Q - What could be the purpose of one?
            A - Daily goals towards bigger goals.
              - I think my practice program fulfills that.
      Q - Which version of Summertime?
        A - Look at learnjazzstandards.com - probably the best resource for canonical.
          - Will probably need to write it out by hand.
      Q - Am I being super inefficient by practicing so many different things?
        A - Not from Trevor's perspective. He says to try different things
            and look for synergy.
      Q - I'm feeling a bit stymied. I don't feel like I'm good at one thing.
        A - If you want to feel more progress, focus on LH chords RH melody.
          - But overall musicianship is going up.
      Q - RH C6 2nd inv to E7 1st inv fingering?
        A - 1 2 3 5  to  1 2 4 5

  Freddie Freeloader: (FOCUS)
    - Feel the internal triplets at slow tempos.
      - Seek this as internal by using only a metronome.

  All of Me: (FOCUS)
    - 10 min - Practice one chord change at a time (4 bar loop) until can play 5 times with no error:
      1 - LH chords
      2 - RH melody
      3 - hands together
    - 5 min - play through the whole thing

2018-12-14

  General:
    - When doing exercises, try increasing by thirds (minor or major) instead of 4ths or 5ths.
      - Avoid building "building" accidentals.
    - Learning quarter note triplets:
      - Tap 8th note triplets with 2 hands alternating then stop one hand
    - Write out a chart of what scales can be played over which chords.
    - Check out Nefertiti by Miles Davis

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Focus on feeling the swing rhythm.
      - With comping - don't rush the Charleston rhythm
      - While soloing - focus on the swing rhythm
    - Focus on bringing in sub 9 and sub 13
      - Play this 9+3+13+7
    - Throw in a /chromatic passing chord/ to get from V7 to IV7 (bV7)
    - Put a #11 on Ab7 b/c it kind of sounds like it's in the key
      - Use lydian b7 scale to solo over this
        - Also known as the "acoustic" scale b/c it has the same notes as the first 11 harmonics

  All of Me:
    - Soloing: bring back improvising in practice (think ballad feel)
      - Over F6 use major
      - Over F-6 use minor
      - Over Eø7 use E locrian, but since it's so short, can just use guide tones
        - Could use D harmonic minor, but don't play the C# during those two beats

  Chameleon:
    - head keeps repeating
    - possible structure
      - bassline 2-4 x
      - bassline w/drums 2-4x
      - add guitar sounds
      - trombone comes in with head, but don't bring head in for a while

2019-01-04

  General:
    - When creating voicings, don't put two 2nds both together. Separate one 2nd.
    - IMPROV:
      - Work on varying your dynamics across the solo.
      - Try replaying the chord in the LH for every RH note.

  Questions:
    Q - Does this work as walking bass for root C I-vi-ii-V7
          C-F-G-G#-A-G-E-D#-D-G-A-G#-G-F-D-C# ???
      A - Not quite. Scale degree 4 is still an avoid note,
          so turn F for C root into E and G for D root into F.
        - C-E-G-G#-A-G-E-D#-D-F-A-G#-G-F-D-C# works.
        - Using a 4th as a passing tone is fine, but that's between two notes, so like 3-4-5.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Think about RH and LH having a conversation.
    - Switch to 1 head - 3 improv - 1 head format.

  All of Me:
    - Literally dumbstruck and could only say "wow" on me playing. YAY!
    - Now it's time to spice up the melody with tensions.
      - For now, add 1 layer of complexity, by choosing one available tension
        and adding it to the improv melody for a particular dom7 chord.
      - For dominant chords, what tensions are available? b9 #9 #11 b13
        - We figured this out by playing all the notes of the mixolydian scale
          and looking at what notes could fit.

2019-01-11

  General:
    - With duets, 3 basic choices wrt what the other person is doing:
      - imitate
      - oppose
      - do something unrelated
    - It's good to play/listen to chords and scales w/altered tones to understand the flavor of each altered tone.
    - Comping:
      - Comp lighter and sparser.
      - Watch out for pattern repetition.
      - Add dynamics.
    - Add childlike playing to practice schedule.

  Questions:
    Q - Is it reasonable to work on chords with two hands together as a mechanism for both hands to learn chords?
      A - Yes.
    Q - Is there "woowoo" magic in music school?
      A - Sometimes.

  All of Me:
    - Try approach note exercises with All of Me.
      - Approach notes are fully articulated neighbor tones - generally chromatic from below and in scale from above.
        - This is opposed to trying to emulate a guitar bend.
      - Try chromatic-from-below approach notes from below as "and" 8th before on-beat chord tones.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Think about playing chords in different registers.
    - Keep the head very simple - that's its charm.
      - Separate the melod and fills from one another.
    - Try chromatic neighbor chords back and forth.
      - More traditional is to change voicings, but good, too.

2019-01-18

  Check out:
    - Bill Wurtz - need progressions and animation
    - John Zorn - Cobra

  Chameleon:
    - Trevor doesn't see a problem with me trying to play the notes shown in the sheet music.
    - Watch out for where the sheet music isn't quite right.
    - Listen to the recording to make sure that my rhythm is correct.
    - Try to emulate the guitar groove w/short rhythmic notes.
    - Try to think in Bb blues, because Trevor thinks switching back and forth will sound tiresome.
    - Think about moving up a half step to B blues in a connected way (both up and down) to add tension.

  All of Me:
    - Don't just use altered tensions as passing tones.
    - Don't play the "regular" tensions for the tensions you've altered.
    Brain Breaker:
      - You can think of a chord with an altered tension as a new chord (E7 with b9 becomes E7b9).
      - Given this new chord, there are specific scales which work well for soloing.
      - b9 over dom7 chord implies 5th mode of harmonic minor.
        - ex E7b9 means 5th mode of A harmonic minor.
      - #11 over dom7 chord implies lydian dominant (lydian b7)

2019-01-25

  Check out:
    - "Roar" with Giant Steps changes.
    - Listen to versions of All of Me to get ideas about playing with the rhythm and fills.

  Questions:
    Q - Aimee Nolte suggestion go make ideas - space - recap - space - etc...
      A - GREAT idea!
        Q - But that leads me to play chords on the 1 and then solo themes on the rest.
          A - "Leave the spaces at different places."
            - Try starting/stopping at different places in the chord section.
            - Listen to the head and use spaces given by the head.
    Q - How do I start learning to play open chords?
      A - Start with open voicing, specifically LH with 3+7 and RH with 1+5 or 9+13.
    Q - Can the altered tensions be avoid notes.
      A - Yes-ish and no-ish. It depends on the tension.
        - Some altered tensions feel like they need resolution like avoid notes do.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Start trying to play 3+7 in LH and 1+5 or 9+13 in RH.

  General:
    - Start bringing a Real Book.

  All of Me:
    - Start playing with the rhythm of the head. And start adding fills.
    - Start playing faster.
      - Or make sure that you're fully embracing the slow. Relax. Use all the space.
    - Practice hearing the notes in your head before playing them (specifically fills).
    - Give more space and be quieter with the LH.

2019-02-01

  General:
    - Play and sing solos more!
    - The lowest pitch of the chord determines which inversion it is.
    - Start transcription (anything in Freddie Freeloader is a good start)
    - Practice singing an octave below the note played.
    Comping:
      - Think of it as a really simple melody line.
    Open chord exercises:
      - Find as whole groups in different octaves
      - Move up/down the keyboard switching lowest scale degrees
        ex - 3+7 & 1+5, 7+3 & 5+1, repeat
      - Arpeggiate chord up/down the keyboard.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Add in voicing changes
      - Exchange the 1+5 in RH with 9+13
      - Keep 3+7 in LH but play one finger melody in RH on 1 or 9 or 5 or 13
      - Use grace notes ore blue notes.

  All of Me:
    - Listen to more versions of this.
    - Listen, transcribe, learn.
    - Set up lesson as - comping for 2 choruses, soloing for 2 choruses, 1-3-1 comping/soloing together.


  Real Book:
    - There are a set of songs based off the chord changes for "I've Got Rhythm".
      - aka the Rhythm Changes
    Chords:
      - BH closed voicing for now.
      - Doing a fine job of playing the chords. Just a slow process of learing everything.
    Melody:
      - Look for places to move hands to new positions and stay there for as long as makes sense.

  Oleo:
    - I-vi-ii-V7
    - The bridge is played as improv.

2019-02-08

  Oleo:
    - For different chords which happen to have the same notes, change the voicing to make it feel different.
      - Adding tensions will make these sound different.
    - Go ahead and slow this down to get the feel of the head.
    - Keep working on it -- chords separate from melody for now.

  General:
    define contrafact
    - a musical composition consisting of a new melody overlaid on a familiar harmonic structure.
    - can also be explained as the use of borrowed chord progressions.

  All of Me:
    - Try comping w/ more long notes
    - Pay attention to what rhythm works with a solo.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Keep working on transcription.

2019-02-15

  General:
    - Switch to Mondays on Mar 4th at 1p.
    - Check out LifeHug - Trevor's fusion project
    Questions:
      Q - How does race fit into your understanding of jazz? Does it play a part?
        A - Big question!
          - It's complex. Almost all jazz students these days are white.
          - There are some white musicians who have contributed to jazz other than Bill Evans.
            In fact, jazz fusion is a much more mixed world than traditional jazz itself.
            ex: Bill Bruford, Alan Holdsworth, Stanley Clarke (black),
              and Weather Report (Wayne Shorter gives legitimacy)

      Q - Is there a viable form of jazz today?
        A - The question kind of needs to be "what would Charlie Parker or Miles Davis be working on,
            if they were musicians today?" WWCPD? WWMDD?
          - Yes. Probably in fusion with hip hop and other electronic music.
            ex: Makaya McCraven
          - Also NeoSoul, ex: Cory Henry and Flying Lotus - check out Cosmic Grandma

      Q - What do you think of Medeski, Martin, and Wood
        A - Lukewarm, not really into jam bands
          - Although check out The Mars Volta - one of Trevor's favorites.


  All of Me:
    - Probably time to put this one away. I've learned a lot in learning it.
      Now it's time to increase repertoire while learning new techniques.
    - When comping, you can
      - Fill space, support the melody, or accent the melody (with parallel rhythm)
    - How to sound more modern and get away from sounding like smooth jazz.
      - quartal voicings, more tensions, and planing
        - good ∆ quartal voicing: 3-6-9 and 2 handed 3-6-9|5-1
        - good dom7 quartal voicing: 3-7-#9 or 7-3-13

  Oleo:
    - Don't leave out the swing, even at very slow tempos. It affects the feel too much.
    Soloing:
      technique 1:
      - measures 1 & 2 - Bb∆ over I∆7 vi-7 ii-7 V7
      - measures 3 & 4 - play G mix ove G7 otherwise Bb∆
      - look at patterns of chord tones not moving much
        - consider these notes as a framework to embellish
        - hit the framework notes on chord changes and embellish elsewhere
        - write out a few licks over I∆7 vi-7 ii-7 V7
      technique 2:
      - think about Bb∆ and use your ear
      - adapt when hitting the G7 chord by moving the Bb note to a natural B

2019-02-22

  General:
    - Look at Lady Bird to be the next song.
    Soloing:
      - Be conscious of the highest note in a solo.
        - Plan to hit hit it only once or twice.
        - Build to hitting it, too. Don't just jump to it. Give it deserved attention.

  Oleo:
    - Split practice b/w irealpro @120 and audacity playing.
    - Try to lay back, especially where there are >=4 consecutive eighth notes.
    - Learn major blues scales for all chords in the bridge (D7, G7, C7, F7)
    comping:
      - When going from Bb6 to G-7, change inversions to distinguish the chords.
      - When going from Bb6 to G7, follow normal voice leading, b/c the chords are already different.
      - Look out for Eb-6.
      - Be sure to follow voice leading through a ii-V7-I, and don't jump.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Be sure to mix up longer chords in the comping. Cutting too short.
    - For 2 handed comping, try to keep them unified, as it fits the song better.
      - Alternating comping is more "funky."
    - We came up with 2 licks in the lesson. Come up with 2 more and practice all 4.

2019-03-01

  general:
    suggestion for electronic music:
      - Try leaving out the bass on measure borders in order to stay congruent with the music.
    exercises:
      - Make sure that every day, you get in-song chord arpeggios.
        - Work on one chord.
        - Use both jazz arps and classical arps.
          - Jazz arps are moving up the keyboard by re-voicng one chord tone higher each time.
          - Classical arps move up the keyboard all at once, running up the octaves by chord tones.
            - See Bastien _Chords and Scales_ for fingerings.
    When trying play cross rhythms/polyrythms:
      - Try loading loading up a lick in musescore and listening to know.
      - Watch Adam Neely video.
        - Divide a line into lowest common multiple of the 2 numbers.
        - Place 3 evenly spaced marks for the 3.
        - Place 4 evenly spaced marks for the 4.
        - Count the whole thing in the LCM.
          ex: 3 on 4 would be 12.
          -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

  Oleo:
    - Tempo goal is 116.
    - Try soloing this week.
    Soloing:
      - Measures 1-4 are covered previously.
        technique 1:
          - measures 1 & 2 - Bb∆ over I∆7 vi-7 ii-7 V7
          - measures 3 & 4 - play G mix over G7 otherwise Bb∆
        technique 2:
          - think about Bb∆ and use your ear
          - adapt when hitting the G7 chord by moving the Bb note to a natural B
       For measures 5-8:
        - Eb∆ for ii-V7-I in Eb
        - Eb dorian over Eb-
        - For ii-V7 in measure 7, C∆
        - In measure 8, Bb∆

  Questions:
    Q - I've been playing 2-handed, same-note-next-octave chords. Is this okay?
      A - Doubling everything is the simplest way of getting a fuller sounding chord while comping. No problem.
        - Other techniques keep fullness while being more "open."
          ex: RH just doubles 1 and 5 or 1-5-1.
    Q - How should my playing style differ when playing electric piano?
      A - Often fuller chords.  1-5-10 in LH, 11ths and 9ths in RH together.
        - Listen to _In a Silent Way_ for how the Rhodes fits in.
        - Listen to Robert Glasper, Cory Henry, and "Red Clay" (in Real Book)
        - E Piano also gives access to using FX.

  General:
    - Look up half-valve trumpet video.
    - Metronome apps to check out: time guru, Super Metronome
    - Trevor said, "You'd be welcome onstage at Stay Gold. Tell them you're a beginner, but it'd be fine."

2019-03-11

  General:
    - Check out ForScore App for music marking up.

  Oleo:
    - Exercise: Play constant 8th notes in mixolydian chords scale on the bridge.
    - This time: Solo over the chords.
    - If excited, check out the diminished whole tone scale.
    - In melody, be sure to make the last C of the Eb-6 run short as well.
    questions:
      Q - What about the D-7 & G7 switches to C-7 & F7 on 2nd & 3rd A section between irealpro and Real Book?
        A - Trevor normally plays D-7 & G7. Sounds like Miles playse C-7 & F7.
          - If there's no other chording instrument, no big deal. Bass determines the chord.
          - If there's a guitar, maybe talk about it, but definitely listen intently.
          - Go listen to recordings and figure it out.

  Freddie Freeloader:
    - Lick #1 is in Bb. It is a Bb blues lick.
    - Personal suggestion: don't run triplets across the middle of the measure.
    - this week:
      - Internalize the licks and try to play them while soloing.
      - Try to fix lick #4 on my own.

2019-03-25

  General:
    - If you make a mistake during a jazz jam on stage:
      - Listen to the chords and jump back in smoothly.
      - Use your ear.
    - Playing on stage highlighted some specific practice needs:
      - multiple voicings for comping
      - playing solos over irealpro w/different settings every time
      - comping while others solo (how?!)
      - playing full songs (head, n solos, head)
      - intros
      - outros
      - remembering chord voicing under pressure
    - Practice flexibility
    - After playing on stage, I felt like the musicians treated me a little differently.
    - Doubling along with someone else exposes differences in timing harshly.
    - New practice routine:
      - 1/3 go over recordings of myself practicing
      - 1/3 transcribing
      - 1/3 watch Trevor and learn

  Comping:
    - Stay out of the way.
    - A trick is to play chords with the ride cymbal or high hat.

  Questions:
    Q - I regularly get lost in the 3 and 2 black key groups. Anything I can do?
      A - Touch groups up the keyboard repeating "two, two, two" then "three, three, three."
        - Move along the keyboard putting thumb down and saying, "C, F, C, F ..."
    Q - Why did the bassist nix "So What"?
      A - It's a technical song that's fun to do if everyone is at the same level.
        - It's easy to get lost in and boring for the bassist.

  Intros and Outros:
    - Try the last 8 bars as an intro.
      - first 4, you should solo.
      - second 4, you should play as written.
    - Tagging
      - Check out "All of You" on _Round_About_Midnight_ - look for the ii-V repeat on outro.

  Oleo
    - Using both hands to double the head is definitely a thing

2019-04-08

  General:
    - Check out the "Maiden Voyage" play-a-long set from Jamey Abersold.
    - May want to look into practicing 3-6-2-5-1.
    Laid back feeling:
      - 1 & 3 are on the beat, where the 2 & 4 are behind the beat.
    Making errors:
      - Don't focus on getting everything right right now. It will come.

  Walking bass:
    - Add walking bass to chord progression practice.
    - Use irealpro to practice (with no bass).
    - Do the forms of the songs this way.
    Choosing notes:
      - Hit the root on the downbeat or chord change.
      - Use as much stepwise motion or chord tones as arps as you can.
      - Play the quarter notes (or half notes to simplify).
      - Chromatic passing tones are great right before the downbeat note.
      - 5ths on the downbeat are okay if a 2nd measure for the same chord.
      - If the chords are slash chords, then use the specified note instead of root.

  Take the A Train:
    - Look up the intro. It's pretty simple.
      - LH G octaves.
      - RH whole tones down from E.

  Oleo:
    Walking bass:
      - Start practicing just the bass line.
      - When you get that, play with irealpro.
      - When you get that, play with chords in RH.
    Soloing:
      - Go an listen to a rhythm changes song.
      - Think Bb pentatonic paying attention to the changes.
        - Can add in Db @ Eb-6, too, to make the major blues.
      - Think in longer phrases of 4 and 8 bars.

  Freddie:
    - In Eb, look out for G in thumb (should be an F).
    - In F, look out for A in thumb (should be a G).
    - Practice LH quiet, RH loud (neither middle).
    - When comping, default to not playing, if you can.
    - Keep working on the blues scale.
      - Run down the blues scale, but hit the root again along with the b5.
    Soloing:
      - Try practicing one lick for an entire solo.
        - Mess around.
        - Have fun.
        - Try to find what you like.
      - SING along with the licks to improve your knowledge of them (and your ear training).

2018-04-15

  Walking bass:
    - Practice walking bass with chords (not melody, takes up too much bandwidth).
    - Practice stride-like bass:
      LH: root, chord, lower fifth, chord
        - can add in leading tone
        - start with: 1, 3-5, 5, 3-5
    - move mostly stepwise or arps
    - On long running 7th chords, can use a triplet note of the current root at the end
      of a run t oget to the root of the next chord.
    - Trevor played some walk-down patterns. Transcribe them, and use them.
    - Know what you're aiming for on the downbeat, and add any extra notes as necessry.

  Check out:
    - Zach Hill as a drummer.
    - "Recorda Me" - Joe Henderson - _Page_One_
      - probably currently above my level, but another good Latinr-feel song.
      - listen while looking at the sheet

  Oleo:
    - Watch the end of the first [A]. Make sure to swing that descent.
    - At end of [B], accent the F to come back into the [A].

  General:
    - To get used to coming in a bit early, count in and practice it.

  Comping:
    - Go listen to a piano solo and see how they're comping for themselves.
    - Try playing *not* on the 1 in one measure, then on the 1 in the next.
    - In Freddie, Wynton Kelly plays very little behind Miles (like total of 1/8th note each measure).
    - Listen to Monk.
    - For fast changes, mostly play on the 1 & 3, but anticipate and delay by 1/8th note.
      - Ex: McCoy Tyner behind Coltrane
    - Think about playing on vs off the beat.
      - Ex: Bobby Timmons behind soloists in Art Blakey's _Moanin'_
    - Can think of yourself as a backing horn section.
    - Basically, there's no right answer. Different pianists do it differently.

  Blue Bossa:
    - Switching to Blue Bossa from Freddie.
    - The Clave Pattern:
      - The bossa nova clave pattern:
        - |X..X..X.|..X..X..| <- more common 3:2 clave
        - |..X..X..|X..X..X.| <- 2:3 clave
      - Try the changes with the clave patterns.

2019-04-22

  Blue Bossa:
    - soloing (easiest way for now)
      | C dorian | C dorian | F dorian | F dorian |
      | C harm m | C harm m | C dorian | C dorian |
      | Db∆ ii   | Db∆ V    | Db∆      | Db∆      |
      | C harm m | C harm m | C dorian | C harm m |
      - remember ii-V-i is in i harm minor
      - For ii-V-i's use more 3rds and 7ths (guide tones) to show the chord movement)
      - Watch out for getting too into the 8th note rhythm.
        - Pretend you're a singer some, then a perc instr some.
    - comping
      - Try comping the straight clave rhythm on top of the bass.
        - bossa nova 2-3
          | . . Ooo . O . . | Ooo . O . . Ooo |
        - 2-3 clave
          | . . Ooo Ooo . . | Ooo . O . . Ooo |

2019-04-29

  General:
    - check out
      - Zach Hill - in Death Grips - epsecially song "Beware"

  Blue Bossa:
    - Make sure first note of the pattern is right on the beat.
    - Practice the pattern without the "1" specifically called out.
    - Stick with just the clave rhythim for now, bossa nova later.
    - Notes in the clave rthyhm should be written so that one can see the quarter
      notes divisions and thereby the synchopation.
    - "bossa nova clave rhythm" may not actually be a thing.
    soloing:
      - Watch out for the B♮ over C- (uly use for the G7)
      - Use C harm minor over Dø & G7, but done use B♮ over Dø.

  Oleo:
    walking bass:
      - avoid repeating notes w/in one measure.
      - good habit - look for the shortest distance between two notes
      - make a habit of listening to the bass part in order to learn bass
    soloing:
      - get that B♮ correctly in place
      - try to wait until you hear it in your mind's ear before you play it
      - Play what you sing!
        - Try to match the piano to your voice.
        - Tried it.
        - When just singing, about 90% of what I sang was pentatonic.
          - It's simple, sounds good, effective, and satisfying.
          - This sung melody was *not* noodling. I gave it direction.
        - Try to sing Bb major pentatonic while following on the piano.
          - Add B♮ in exactly the right places.
          - Do each major pentatonic in the bridge.

  Questions:
    Q - What is 3-6-2-5-1 ??
      A - A progression, where 3-6-2 is effectively a 2-5-1 leading to the ending on the 2 of the final 1.
        - For instance Em7 - A7 - Dm7 - G7 - C∆7, but there are lots of variations.

      Glossolallia Online - Sunday 26th - Kenny Dorham's Backyard at 7p "Jazz Outside" "Call It Anything" in auschron
      Batch has started a new free jazz jam.
    putting parts together:
      - really go beyond what you expect in learning the parts individually
        before trying to put them together.
      - REALLY LEARN each part well.
        - learn to boredom plus 3 more reps.
        - better to wait and get each hand solidly down
    swing vs latin:
      - Some pieces move back and forth with the swing and latin (no swing) feel.
        - "Night in Tunisia"
        - "Green Dolphin Street"
    two minute show and tell

  Blue Bossa:
    bass:
      - My bass assessment was correct.
        - root on 1, 5th on and-of-2 and 3
    comping:
      - remember to comp with the ride cymbal
      - listen to the drummer
      - To avoid wrist pain, bounce off the keys.

  Oleo:
    comping:
      - Playing the chords on the 1 and 3 (with a 1/8th note anticipation or delay) is pretty standard.
        - These are *fast* changes.
    comping AND playing melody:
      - Get it down in each hand individually before bringing it together.
    walking bass and melody together:
      - This is HARD.
      - Try 1/2 note bass line of root chord first.
      - 3rds and 6ths (or 7ths) over bass notes sound good.
        - 6ths or 7ths according to chord type

  Summertime:
    Try going back and playing the fully written out piece HANDS APART.

2019-05-20

  general:
    - Let's keep non-musical stuff to email.
    - Trevor'd been thinking that I was ready for a next step already.
      - I've now studied jazz for a year.
      - If I was studying a language for this amount of time, I'd still be having stuttered
        conversations. This is a fine place to be.
    - Trevor compares classical theory to jazz theory, and jazz is more *practical*.
      - It's about the experience in the moment and improvising with that.
      - Free jazz is jazz theory in a blender.
    - Some "out there" idioms:
      - Try playing up a solo in a key up a half-step for a period.
      - Try playing different keys in different hands. This is called bitonality.
    soloing:
    - On listening to my solo during Blue Monk with jazz combo --
      - Especially without drummer, make sure you're setting an appropriate swing feel.
      - Watch out for rushing.
      - When playing a simple solo, try octave doubling to add fullness.
    check out:
      - Nerve - artist on bandcamp.

    new lesson format:
      - Let's take a "lesson break" from jazz, but keep praciticing at home.
        - Do want to get to a place of "completed" with Oleo and Blue Bossa.
          - This means can play head and solo with LH comping on each.
      - Want to spend more focus on ear training.
      - "Don't practice for our lessons."
      - 20 min questions, 20 min ear training, 20 min composition

  Ear Training:
    - Yes, you can't always sing to figure out intervals.
      You can still get a lot out of what you are able to do.
    - Need to work on the brain-to-finger connection.
    - Let's try some sight singing. Trevor will bring a book.

  Let It Go:
    - Let's add figuring this out to our lesson and home practice.
    - Seems to be in Ab.

  Questions:
    Q I listened to a Ray Charles and was happy to think I could hear the chords!
      But it seemed to be 12 bar blues in an unusual form, I-I-I-I I-I-I-I V-IV-I-I.
      A That's a weird form, but it reminds me of the extended blues form, where
        the 12-bar pattern is extended by repeating the first 4 root measures, often for the vocalist.
        During the non-vocal sections, however, this is reduced back to 12 measures.
        (On my own research, it seems like there's lots of ways this extended form is made/used.)

  general:
    - new format 20 min questions, 20 min ear training, 20 min composition
    CHECKOUT:
      - Well Tempered Clavier and score follow if can.

  questions:
    Q - I feel like I need some more chord progressions to add to my practice
      A - iv to I  =>  iv7-bVII7-I7  =>  ex Fm7-Bb7-C∆7
          - Can also make this into a circular exercise, by turning I∆7 into m and starting over.
            This will lead around the circle of 4ths.
        - Get other progressions from ear training and real book exercises.
    Q - Why didn't jamming this year feel as good as last time?
      A - How to lead is a really big question. (Trevor may not know the answer.)
        - Learn how to get other's attention while playing.
        - When trying to figure out what others are playing, look for the bass line.
          - Or maybe go atmospheric atonal.
    Q - How important is it right now to play in other keys?
      A - It's awesome, but it obviously takes time.
        - Start by trying to learn a song transposed by a 4th, 5th, or half step up or down.
        - It is really important to be able to play vocal tunes in all twelve keys.
        - Tunes written by horn players are usually NOT going to be played in other keys.
        - Maybe start now my adding Summertime in Dm.

  ear training:
    - Maybe an extra lesson might be:
      - How to listen closely.
      - How to get information (transcription) out of music.
    - Exercises:
      - Sing up the major scale with root every other note (with and without piano).
        - Do - Re - Do - Mi - Do - Fa - Do - Sol - Do - La - Do - Ti - Do - Do(8va) - Do
      - Sing down the major scale with root every other note (with and without piano).
        - Do - Do(8va) - Do - Ti - Do - La - Do - Sol - Do - Fa - Do - Mi - Do - Re - Do
      - Sing up the chromatic scale (with piano only).
        - 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - t - e - 0 -
      - Sing  the chromatic scale (with piano only).
        - 0 - e - t - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0 -
    - For now add these exercises to practice, stick with major and chromatic.
    - Remember that tuning is 90% of voice work.
    - Get rhythm of Let It Go for next week.

  compositon:
    - Take a motif.
      - Change it in time (rhythm).
      - Change it in pitch (melody).
      - Change it in support (harmony).
    - Try to do more single notes.
      - Make an exercise of playing single notes in both LH and RH and make sure
        to recognize the interval b/w them.

2019-06-09

  general:
    - Add "get a chord progression" to your chord progression practice.

  questions:
    Q - Keeping track of where I am when playing with others is difficult.
      A - Need to count super solidly in order to keep track.
        - Look for checkpoints/landmarks in a song to catch.
        - Listen for chord qualities.

  Sight Singing
    Book:
    - Read Intro.
    - Try Exercises 1-3.
      - On each exercise, go slowly on the way down and LOCK IN with pitches.
    Exercises:
      - Downward leaps are harder, expecially greater than a fifth.
    Isolated Intervals:
      - Trevor describes
        - perfect consonance (fifths octaves) as sounding hollow.
        - imperfect consance (maj and min thirds and sixths) as sweet, full, and rich.
        - dissonances
          - ∆7 as biting, or maybe sweet?
          - m7
      - I should try to go through the intervals and come up with my own descriptive terms.
      - Trevor's hierarchy:
        Interval Identification by Ear
          - consonant
            - imperfect
              - m3, ∆3, m6, M6
            - perfect
              - P4, P5, P8
          - dissonant
            - small
              - m2, ∆2
            - tritone
            - large
              - m7, ∆7
        - Later, I can try to do melodic instead of harmonic relationships.

  Composition:
    - Current song uses Ab∆7 -> Db∆7 -> Gb∆7.
      - This is a pretty key-ambiguous progression.
      - It's kind of a I∆7 -> IV∆7 -> bVII∆7 in Ab
        but it's also a II∆7 -> V∆7 -> I∆7 in Gb.
        Trevor also says it's like a back door ii-V7-I.
      - "constant structure"
        - Using the same chord structure with multiple non-scale roots can keep
          the listener from hearing the lack of key as a problem.
      - Voice leading can help. Chromatic notes can help with the voice leading.
    - Bernstein has a whole lecture on ambiguity in music.
    - Embelish with passing tones.
    - Given an intro, repeat, elaborate (modify) structure can use
      2 bars + 2 bars + 4 bars to make this happen.
    - If something feels/sounds right, it is right. Make it happen.
      Analyze later when looking back.
    - Need to make time to move this forward.

  Active/Analytical Listening:
    - On a first listen, what do you try to listen to/for?
      Anderson - form of the song, instrumentation, try to get a feel for the head?
      Trevor - maybe don't try to do too much analysis.
        - Listen to a single instrument. Think about what that player is doing.
          - As they are playing, what did they do that you didn't expect?
            - Ex. Would I comp when they were comping?
        - Focus on one instrument/part for a whole listen of a song.
        - Maybe listen for whether AABA form or 32 bars in the head?
      Q - How to listen to a solo to internalize it?
        A - Sing it so that you can sing every note.

          - Tried giving this a first listen in the lesson.
          - Tried listening to the sax solo, then singing it on a second listen.
        "Run to the Hills":
          - Tried singing along with the solo. Did okay.
      - Try to take on 5 min of active listening a day away from the keyboard.
        - When you hear tunes playing anywhere, try ot sing along with them.
        - Have to focus on both the big picture and the technical details.
    - Given a longer listening:
      - First listen, what jumps out?
      - On repeated listens at the piano find, in order:
        - key, form, melody, bass line, chords
      - Sheet music becomes a short cut.
      - Everyone has some point of complexity beyond which, you have to write stuff down.

  Questions:
    Q - Fusion seems to have a lot more parts where things are arranged or played in unison?
      A - Everyone playing in unison is showing off virtuosity, bravado.
        - Fusion is often the high-water mark for virtuosity.
        - Definitely more elaborate arrangements found in Fusion.
        - Checked out "Some Skunk Funk," which may be the "whiter" side of Fusion, but
          Herbie Hancock's _Thrust_ album is another great example (also of improv in fusion).
    Q - Do walking bass lines do as much to define the harmonies as single notes.
      A - Yes.
    Q - How do you keep up with where you are in the structure with multiple people playing at the same time?
      A - establish a leader
        - establish cues
        - set up a precess which has clear end points (maybe more for freer improv)
        - maybe try setting up cues with others in the Rainbow Connection sessions.

  GOALS: (I spent some time defining musical goals. Here's what I've landed on.)
    - Write a Marco-Wasteland song. (Song in a day July 1st.)
    - Keep improving with the jazz combo with jazz practice (chords, scales, repertoire).
    - Improve my ear/mind connection in order to improve all my playing (ear, singing).
    - Improve my guitar and singing performance for kids (Let It Go on guitar, chords up the neck).
    - Help Nobie get better (figure out how to accompany Nobie).
    - Record Solid Dead Eye in one take. (practice to make perfect)

 quick rewrite to print out

  GOALS:
    - Write a Marco-Wasteland song.
      - song in a day July 1st
    - Keep improving with the jazz combo.
      - chord progression, scales, repertoire
    - Improve my ear/mind connection.
      - ear training, sight singing, transcribe "Let It Go"
    - Improve my guitar and singing performance for kids.
      - learn Let It Go on guitar, learn chords up the neck
    - Help Nobie get better.
      - figure out how to accompany Nobie
    - Record Solid Dead Eye in one take.
      - practice to make perfect

  Let It Go:
    - B/w transcribing the bass and the melody, probably can write out the chords pretty quickly.

  teaching:
    - You have to create a solid foundation on which to build everything else.
    kids:
      - Don't let them get frustrated.
      - Their attention span is 2-3 minutes, so be prepared with activities.
    accompaniment:
      - Gb major is going to work for black key accompaniment.
        - level 1
          - play bass notes 1 and 5 while alternating triad.
        - level 2
          - play the I and V7 chords.
      - Jump ahead to have time to learn something by rote if necessary.
        - Learn hands apart VERY WELL, then put together.

  conducting:
    - Wrist and hand should be loose.
    - Each beat should have an "ictus" on the beat (a little pop).
      - Ictus literally means "fit" or "seizure."
    - The last beat before the 1 is always on the outside.
      - This means beat two of 4/4 is on the inside.

  sight singing:
    - In classical music, the slur may simply be a phrase marker.
      - Try to sing the entire slur mark in one breath.
    - Find and use landmarks in the melodic line.
    - Work hard to hit the actual note.
    - New exercise regimen:
      - Play a "random" note and try to sing it.
      - Play and sing the line together once.
      - Sing, rooting at the beginning of the phrase and checking at the end.
      - Sing and only check at the end of the phrase.
    - Move on to exercises 4, 5, and 6.

  deep listening:
    - When deep listening, the first 5 min can seem especially difficult.
      - It gets easier.
      - This is especially true, if it's a complicated and/or unfamiliar song.
      - Try to block out 20 min or so to get over this.

2019-06-24

  general:
    - In chromatic scales, pitch class is fixed, so C is always 0.

  questions:
    Q - Singing with a tuner? Is it bad?
      A - Not at all, but it's training wheels. Want to sing by feeling whether # or b.
    Q - When singing using auralization, I'm sometimes more accurate. What up?
      A - This is great. Work on that, too!
    Q - Where to get major blues fingerings from?
      A - Google, though, yes, they are hard to find.

  sight singing:
    conducting:
    - Go ahead and drop the conducting for now.
    - Can practice conducting with recordings.
      - To be completely accurate, you're the leader, so need to be ahead of the beat.
    singing:
      - Keep avoiding starting by singing the Do note, regardless of what syllable you're saying.
      - Move to exercises 7-9.

  Summertime in Dm:
    - Play melody in C3 range to avoid collision (also tone cuts through there better).
    - C2 range is the "butter" range.
      - This area has been overplayed, so consider that when making choices.
    my playing:
      - watch out for accidentals in the LH.
      - practice the Dm harmonic in scales to get the chords.
        - add Dm harmonic in scales practice.
        - play this before playing random scale for now.
    soloing:
      - Trevor likes playing the naturnal minor over the i chord.
      - Whenever you see a half-diminished chord (m7b5) think ii chord in minor key.
      - Eø is Dm; A7 is Dm harmonic.
      - Also try a blues scale, since this song kind of has a blues form.

2019-07-01

  sight singing:
    - The first steps in this are REALLY hard.
      - There doesn't seem to be any getting around that.
    - Try to hold Do in your mind the whole phrase.
    - Try playing Do the whole time.
    - Try the exercise of Do to another scale degree, sing, then judge # or b.
    - Try recording yourself.
    - Try apps for drone tones, and sing on top of them.
    - Only play and sing or conduct and sing for now. All 3 is too much.

2019-07-08

  The Girl From Ipanema - Jobim:
    - This is a calm and understated song, but there's a lot going on.
    - Vocals are not generally on the rhythmic grid, but are aware of it.
      - It's an artistic choice to play around the beat.
      - This is *not* rubato, but beat placement.
    bridge:
      chord: | Gb∆7         | B7           | F#-7         | D7
      scale: | Gb lyd       | B mix        | F# dor       | D mix

      chord: | G-7          | Eb7          | A-7   D7b9   | G-7   C7b9
      scale: | G dor        | Eb mix       | A dor G harm | G dor F harm

      - A-7 to D7b9 can be considered the ii-V7 in G.
      - G-7 to C7b9 can be considered the ii-V7 in F.

  Questions:
    Q: Okay, I see the benefit of learning an easy/intermmediate classical piece. Which one(s)?
    A: Essential Keyboard Repertoire Vol 1 by Alfred

    Q: What is Functional Harmony?
    A: For this week, look it up. Bring questions next time, if you want.

  Sight Singing:
    - Practice conducting using videos? Use sight singing book as reference.
    - REMEMBER to tonicize the key using I-IV-I-V-I.
    - This week, try singing it cold as a first step.
      - Move back to singing with piano if that doesn't work.
      - Feel free to move ahead in exercise if you get it right every time.
    - Move on to Ex 13-15 this week.

  Let It Go:
    Q: How do you, Trevor, go about figuring out the chords to a song?
    A: - Start at the beginning or the chorus.
       - Listen through.
         It's not going to be obvious the first few listens.
       - Listen to the chord quality. Possibly get that from the melody.

    Seems like there's the verse part 1, verse part 2, and chorus.
      verse pt 1
        chords  |: F5   Db5  Eb5  Bb5 :|
        melody  |: Fm   Db   Eb   Bbm :|

      verse pt 2
        chords  |: Eb5  Db5 :|
        chords  |: Eb   Db  :|

      chorus
        chords  |: Ab   Eb   Fm   Db :|

  Questions:
    Q: Why do people seem to respond when people mention "falsetto?"
    A: - Basically, it's a social and cultural response. This may stem from the castrati.
       - There are plenty of fantastic falsetto male singers (Robert Plant, Cedric from The Mars Volta,
         Frank Ocean on album Blond).
       - It's easy for it to sound silly (adding vibrato may help with that), so do it well.
    Q: Flashcards - I made some.
    A: - Made corrections on the flashcards themselves, but
                 ∆ M -    major scale (avoid 4th), major blues, lydian
                 - m -  natural minor, dorian, minor blues
                   7 -  mixolydian, super locrian (altered scale)
              ø -7b5 -  half-diminished (locrian)
                   o -  diminished scale (modern sound)
             ii-V7-I - I major with chord/guide tones.
         iiø7-V7-i-7 - I harmonic minor with chord/guide tones.
       - Make 24 flashcards for the ii-V7 combinations in all major and minors.

  Minuet - Bach:
    - Should be all even 8th notes.
    - Use 8th note subdivisions on the metronome to learn.
    - A minuet is a part of a dance suite.

2019-07-29

  General:
    - out aug 5th, Lex to sub augh 12th, out aug 19th, back aug 26th

  sight-singing:
    - move triad I-IV-I-V-I back in to daily warm ups (major or minor)
    - skips
      - GO SLOW!!
      - Keep using the piano with skips.
      - Play Do, then guess the note with the voice, then check with piano.
        - Figure out if over- or under-shot, and try again.
      - Try to figure out if intervals are "locked" or not.
      - Look into differences of just intonation if interested.

  Solid Dead Eye
    - Go chord by chord and practice soloing on RH.
      - Start with half or quarter notes.
    - Listen to some stock blues endings.
    - I'm currently using the ∆7 as a blues note in the ending,
      but I'm not using it anywhere else.

  Special guest teacher Jackson Van Norman subbing in for Trevor.

  General:
    - For real book exercise:
      - Try walking through the inversions of each chord.
    - Solo Piano:
      - About 70% of the chords will be rooted to keep the original feel.
    - When looking to create rootless voicings:
      - A simple way is to replace the root with the 9 (b, ♮, or #).
      - Can also think of it as building a 7 chord off the 3rd scale degree in scale.
      - Can also create upper structure by making a triad rooted on the 9th degree.
        Ex. C∆ is the upper structure of Bb7#11.
      - A ∆ triad built off the 5th degree is the ∆9.
        - You can leave out the 3rd, 5th, and 7th of the LH, and still get a similar effect.
    - A different way to think of the chords available in a key:
      - Consider each the I chord of the mode from the scale degree.
        - Ex. The I of dorian is m7, so, since the dorian mode is the from the
              2nd degree of the major scale, the 2nd degree chord is m7.
              ∆7 - Ionian
              m7 - Dorian
              m7 - Phrygian
              ∆7 - Lydian
              ∆7 - Mixolydian
              m7 - Aeolian
              ø7 - Locrian

    - The Amazing Slow Downer app for slowing down tracks for transcribing.

  Sabbatical and what to do with it:
    - First thought is to write stuff: songs, jazz pieces, make stuff from scratch
      - This leads to learning technique because you have to figure out how to become
        capable of doing what is necessary for the piece.
    - Learn other instruments.
    - Arrange pieces out as performance pieces.
      - Try to come up with multiple ways to play the piece.
        - This can be useful for pushing past habits, because only one would be
          your comfortable way of playing the piece.
    - Transcribe songs
      - Use this to internalize ideas.
    - Improve sight reading.
      - The faster you can read a piece, the faster you can learn it.
      - Try to learn from a composer's writing so that you are looking at the composer's thoughts.
    - There is a balance between composing and practicing.
      - They do each require time.
    - FOLLOW YOUR EXCITEMENT!
      - This is maybe the best thing Jackson said to me.
      - It does remind me that there is value in seeing what excites me.

2019-08-26

  Sabbatical and what woudl you do with it:
    - Using emotional reactions of intervals to create chords
    - Algorithmic composition -> AI composition
      - Something that allows high-level control over music
      - How do we define ourselves when computer-generated music is indistinguishable
        from human-created music?
    - Specific to jazz
      - Practice things I see other musicians doing, that I understand, but can't yet do.
        ex. low 5ths to make a chord more full
    - Sightsinging, eartraining - it affects everything like composition and analysis
    - To force creativity:
      - Finish a song each week!
      - Try to make 3 bad ideas a day. Probably one of them won't be.

  Questions:
    Q - Is G#m a key? Why not Abm?
      A - Yes, because minor keys use the relative major keys for naming.
        - Here, the G# is used because it is found in the key of B.
    Q - Fingering for Eb major blues?
      A - Figure it out. Do what works. Here's a suggestion
          RH 2 1 2 3 4 1 2
          LH 4 3 2 1 2 1 4

  Flashcard recommendations:
    - major scales
    - all 3 minor scales: natural, harmonic, melodic
    - major scale triads

  Exercie recommendations:
    - For 3 keys each day:
      - play through a 3 octave blast of
        - major scale
        - harmonic minor scale
        - melodic minor scale
        - natural minor scale
        - I IV I V I (triads in major)
        - i iv i V i (triads in harmonic minor)

2019-09-03

  Not exactly a lesson, but putting my emotional responses into digital format.

  minor second
    - worry, concern, tentative, pulsating, distressing, introducing tension (not musical)
  major second
    - taking one majestic step, turning to look
  minor third
    - hestiation, unfulfilled, missed opporutinty, a call for someone not there
  major third
    - a foundational step forward, a preparation, anticipation
  perfect fourth
    - desirous, turning, asking, petitioning, slightly disappointed
  tritone
    - banging into a door, sourness, thing you're holding breaks, lens shifting, something gone wrong
  perfect fifth
    - pastoral woods and fields, majestic, royal, announcing
  minor sixth
    - melancholy with solace, watching a hunting bird, still while others rush
  major sixth
    - rising above expectations, awakening, looking up, reaching out
  minor seventh
    - lonely, isolated, desolate, surrounded by air, empty, not wanting for anyone
  major seventh
    - reaching but not quite there, refocussing attention, a truning aside, an added element drawing focus
  octave
    - super consonant, fitting in, relaxation, home, comfort

      - Sam Graf's Yacht Rock band - actually called Heavy Mellow.

  Bach's Minuet:
    - Don't be afraid to write in note names on the music at trouble spots.
      - This acts as a *pay attention* reminder.
      - F# is one of your trouble spots.
    - Measure by measure, start putting hands together.
      - Do at least a measure + a beat. 2 measures is also fine.
    - Can use as a model piece to write my own piece.
      - Just writing 8 bars would be informative and educational.
      - When writing, remember that the edges of the range that you're using are "intense."
      - Probably on use the extremes once in a composition.

  Solid Dead Eye:
    - Make recordings.

2019-09-11

  Solid Dead Eye:
    Soloing:
    - Keep trying solos with just quarter notes.
    - It looks like doing something "interesting" is what throws me off.
    - Look for these things that mess up my LH, stop immediately, and focus on practicing that.
    Pain/tightness in wrist:
    - Bounce the hand with each "stab."
    - Practice this looseness to get the motion signature of it.

  Summertime:
    - On the ii-V7-i and ii-V7-I, THINK GUIDE TONES!
    - Use iRealPro - Let it play bass and drums on repeat.
      - Play the LH chords with RH VERY SIMPLE (whole notes).
      - Play the LH chords with RH melody. Use chord tones almost exclusively.

  Minuet:
    - Once you "get" a section, repeat at least 3 times or until "set."
    - Finger transfer is not a bad thing.
    - Repeating a note is a great time to change fingers, also.
    - Similarly, can change fingers when going back to a note.
    - Keep chugging.

  Sight Singing:
    - Try to be conscious of what scale degree I'm on.
    - Visualize the piano and what note I'm singing.
    - Check in along the way.
    - Keep it SIMPLE. Stay in tune. Be aware of where you are on the scale.
    - Be sure to look at the key to see what makes sense for my voice.

  General:
    - I was 15 min late because I thought it was 2:30 instead of 2:15p. :(

  Questions:
    Q - Why does sightsinging ex 35 have the key and roman numeral analysis above it?
      A - No idea, but it's useful. Don't worry about it.
    Q - How should I tonicize minor keys?
      A - For now, use major V or V7.
    Q - How do I write out the chord progression of the first 4 bars of "Golden Lady"?
      A - Probably best to think of it as changing keys for the last bar.
        Q - How would I notate this?
          A - There really isn't a standard way.
            - To use a Roman numeral analysis implies functional harmony, which isn't correct.
              - I∆7 - ii-7 - iii-7 - iv+-7 - VII7sus4
              Q - What exactly is a 7sus4 chord?
                A - move the 3 of a dom7 chord to a P4.
      Q - How should I play through my Real Book exercise? Can I just do the same in both hands still?
        A - Yes, that's no problem. Just use close voicings for slash chords.

  Solid Dead Eye:
    Suggestions:
      - Play the end turnaround with BH.
      - It's really long for a blues tune. 2-3 stanzas of lyrics should be the max.
      - Keep working on hand independence.
      - Think about making the LH sound be root plus 5th, ∆6th, m7th, ∆6th.
    Soloing:
      - Try playing the LH stab ONLY on the quarter notes to keep things simple for now.
        - This could be for practice, or could be a new way to play it during the solo.

  Summertime:
    - Only practice the hard spots at 55bpm (focusing on small chunks for practice efficiency).
    Soloing:
      - Remember the 4 is an avoid note over any ∆ triad, including the dom7.

  General:
    - cancelled last week -- currently owed 1 lesson.
    checkout:
      - The Meters "Ain't No Use"

  Synth Jams:
    - I've been finding myself repeating ideas in the synth jams, and I want to break out a bit.
      1 - If going super simple, stick with a minor chord, then work around with intervals of that root.
          3rds (regular chords), 4ths (quartal chords), and 6ths.
      2 - Can also stick with a single note, then use a bunch of chords which all use that note
          (for instance, using C, go with Cmaj7, Amin7, Fmaj7, D7, B9, etc)
      3 - Can use “constant structure,” so just jump around with all min9 chords.
          It’s not in a “key,” but our brains seem to like it.

  transcription practice:
    - YES! This is a "big lift" exercise and will improve ear, rhythm, melody, soloing, licks, and all.
    - Let's shoot for a chorus or two this week.

  Summertime:
    Soloing:
      - Resolve 6th dissonance of natural minor quickly, if used.
      - Work hard to keep on top of where you are.
      - Try to start and end on chord tones OTHER than the root.
    Bass:
      - work on 1-5-1 in the LH bass while playing chord whole notes in RH.
      - Look for close connections with the bass note which changing chords.

2019-10-09

  Summertime:
    - Yay, guidetones work. But let's take the *next* step.
    - Try arpeggiating the chords and consider voice leading.
    - Looking at 2-5-1s,
      - Line up a scale run (of I) so that it fits with the chord changes.
      - See piano lick 3.
    - BTW A7+9 means A7#9(!).

  Upper Structures:
    - This is in the Mark Levine book -- The Jazz Piano Book, p109.
    - For altered dom 7 chords can create as...
      - 3+7 or 7+3 in the LH, and
      - any triad in the RH w/o P4 or ∆7.
        - Also can do 4th (quartal) chords in the RH, but more advanced.

2019-10-17

  general:
    - Things I worked on: Minuet, Solid Dead Eye, Summertime (licks), All Blues, Sight Singing

  checkout:
    - "Same Old Blues" - Freddy King version
      - Great changes - Follow along on irealpro or wherever.
      - This is an example of the kinds of changes found in newer blues tunes.

  All Blues:
    - Watch out for rushing when adding the piano part in during intro.
    soloing:
      - Use mixolydian (or blues).
        - Mixolydian makes more sense b/c the head melody uses mixolydian notes.
      - Listen to solos:
        - Miles (trumpet) - space, air, pointing out Bb vs B in C7 and G7, some maj blues
        - Cannonball Adderly (alto sax) - lots more notes, extensions, aprs, repeating notes 2 times
        - Coltrane (tenor sax) - blues licks, can add extensions to the V chord
          - transposition of solo in interesting spot - #9 to b13
        - Evans (piano) - parallel structure reminiscent of "So What"
          - sparse at beginning.
      - many line endings on 9 -> sounds more like jazz blues than straight blues
      - You solo better if you listen to songs before trying to play the solos.
      - Work on soloing using block chords in LH. Eventually, working towards the G7 "cliche" in G7 & C7.

  Summertime:
    - Work on transcribing the next 2 licks.
    soloing:
      - Look out for the A7.
        - If you resolve to the guide tone of the C (the 7 of the D7), move away quickly.
      - You're getting stuck in teh same range.
      - You're getting stuck starting and ending on root notes.
    structure:
      - Keep working on counting this and knowing where you are.

2019-10-23

  New songs:
    I've been asked to play several songs:
      general:
        - If you have the changes, do what you can.
          - Play just the bass notes, if that's all you can do.
        - If you don't have the changes, can you do it by ear?
      I've Got You Under My Skin:
        - This has a weird structure.
      Autumn Leaves:
        - Usually in Gm, but the Real Book has it listed in Em.
      Footprints:
        - Very cool tune. Check out recordings.
        - Can be thought of a 24 bar blues in 3 or 12 bar in 6.
        Intro:
          - Bass vamp repeats a number of times.
          - The piano or guitar gradually comes in.
          - This is made into a nice intro.
        The one hard line:
          CHORDS:
            - Can simplify chords to make the line easier.
            - Going rootless is a good idea (except for the F#).
            - Can also use the "So What" quartal voicings.
            F#-7b5: A C E F#
            F7#11: The #11 is in the melody so could leave it out. A C Eb F
              Otherwise swap out the #11 for the 5. A B Eb G (The 11 implies the 9.)
            E7b5(#9): G# Bb D G
            A7b5(#9): C# Eb G C
              - Try to place the #9 above the ∆3 so it doesn't sound dissonant.
              - Note: the #9s are in the melody, so maybe don't have to worry about those.
          SOLOS/SCALES:
            - F#-7b5 is Fø7:
              The locrian is good over this -- H W W H W W W - locrian: 7 of ∆
            - F7#11:
              Can be seen as tritone substitution for B, but E♮ sounds weird in that situation.
              Use F lydian dominant, aka lydian b7 -- W W W H W H W - lydian b7: 4 of ∆ w/mod
            - 7b5s use an altered diminished scale.
              This is the diminished scale with whole tones at the end.
              H W H W W W W
              Or could just hang on chord tones and would be fine.

  Summertime:
    - Start incorporating licks!
