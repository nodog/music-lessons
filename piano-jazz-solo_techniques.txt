SOLO TECHNIQUES TO FOCUS ON FOR ONE CHORUS
------------------------------------------
- vary note lengths
- use tuplets - including tuplet rests and ties
- use approach notes from below
- alter phrase length
- shoot for chord tones at important points (1 and 3?)
- form short ideas (2 to 4 beats), repeat those
- repeat motif in same location, but switch individual notes to match the chord/scale
- start and end phrase in different places (not just 1 and 4)
- use unusual accents and polyrhythms
- scalar patterns in sequence
- interval patterns in sequence - extend to triads and seventh chords
- quartal voicing pattern in sequence
- make a 2 hand voicing and use planing
- same rhythm movement in both hands
- make a low 5th interval, then move elsewhere
- "lickish" - 1-4-5-1 - like "Love Supreme"
- bluesy licks
- LH short comp chords with RH smooth 8th note lines
- move LH around but have RH focus on 1 note, use to build tension at chord change
- use rhythmic quotes as inspiration - rhythm not melody
- improv should be about 80% steps and 20% skips
- especially when playing simple parts, think about articulation
- stick to one scale across chords finding common tones
- improv around simple ideas, but build progression and complexity
- scat/sing along with the improv to keep it lyrical
- think about structural aspects: simple to complex, short to long, repeats, and space
